0
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,410
- [Narrator] So let&#39;s, let&#39;s go to the numerator group page

1
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:05,540
and take a look at that.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,870
What we have here are the default numerator groups,

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,310
general service statistics.

4
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:14,100
You see how number of physicians has been added to it

5
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,283
and then various programs.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,403
And notice these buttons.

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,900
So, just as we can add a numerator,

8
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,550
we can add a numerator group,

9
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:27,730
and that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,130
Um, I hope by the end of the session,

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,500
we&#39;ll get uh, get around to talking about

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:37,780
how the tool can be used at district level routinely.

13
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,920
And for that, of course, at district level,

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,330
they, they might use Core,

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,780
that we&#39;ve discussed before,

16
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,660
or you might actually create a group

17
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,270
just for the district.

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:53,620
In fact, there might be multiple groups

19
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,940
for the district so that it, uh

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,480
the district could have a tailored group

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,220
that it was looking at the indicators

22
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,690
that it felt were most important.

23
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,700
Of course, to do that

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,130
they would have to work with

25
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,240
the national data administrator.

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,430
But you could imagine, uh,

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,210
that being worked out.

28
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,500
The district is not going to have

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,840
the access to configure the tool,

30
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,880
but you could imagine them working

31
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,900
with the national data administrator to add

32
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,400
a group just for their district.

33
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,220
But what I&#39;m going to add now

34
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,653
is the group called Human Resources.

35
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:36,570
(typing)

36
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,690
- [Narrator] Should have done better

37
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,060
in high school typing class,

38
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,130
but anyway, uh, okay.

39
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,833
So, we have now the group here, but it&#39;s empty.

40
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,923
So we&#39;re going to add to that.

41
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,343
Scroll down and find what we&#39;ve just configured.

42
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:58,040
Number of Physicians.

43
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,540
Now you might think that it&#39;s been added,

44
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,630
but you&#39;ve got to take one more step.

45
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,800
This is actually not in the group yet.

46
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,710
It&#39;s just been selected from the dropdown menu.

47
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,640
So we have to click on that.

48
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,940
And finally, it&#39;s in the, uh

49
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,253
it&#39;s in the Human Resources group.

50
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,110
But let&#39;s go back to numerators.

51
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:24,150
So now, if you look at, uh,

52
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,290
this new reference numerator,

53
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,090
you see it&#39;s in two groups.

54
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:31,330
It&#39;s in the General Service Statistics,

55
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:34,830
and it&#39;s also in the Human Resources group.

56
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,600
And on the dashboard,

57
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,453
since we&#39;ve added a new group,

58
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:43,580
we now have that in the dropdown menu,

59
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:47,910
that in the settings window of the dropdown menu,

60
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,730
we can select Human Resources.

61
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,320
And for some reason,

62
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,400
the completeness of the staffing data set

63
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,380
isn&#39;t appearing.

64
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,280
Let me see if there&#39;s something more

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,200
that has to be done.

66
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,850
Yeah, somehow I didn&#39;t, notice here,

67
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,300
the dataset hasn&#39;t appeared

68
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,320
and every once in a while the, this happens.

69
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,930
And if you don&#39;t see

70
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,490
the completeness on the dashboard,

71
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,410
go back to configuration,

72
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,220
to administration and see if the data set is there.

73
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:25,030
I think I have, what I have to do is redo this.

74
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,180
Can&#39;t explain to you why it doesn&#39;t,

75
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,370
hasn&#39;t appeared.

76
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:30,790
Cause I thought I selected data staffing,

77
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,610
data set, but,

78
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,443
maybe not.

79
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,310
Um, Okay. Dataset for completeness.

80
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:44,110
Let&#39;s see if we can get this app.

81
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:44,943
Okay.

82
00:03:44,943 --> 00:03:47,350
So now we&#39;ve got the data set in there

83
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:50,290
and if we go back to the dashboard,

84
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,200
we can select our Human Resources group,

85
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,240
there, there we are.

86
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,720
It&#39;s, and as is typical,

87
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,683
we&#39;ve got a pretty low reporting rate.

88
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,220
Um, oh these are, by the way,

89
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,840
this is kind of a strange thing

90
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,420
to put on the dashboard because

91
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:15,420
the HR data is probably reported only annually.

92
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,900
And uh, so you can&#39;t, for example,

93
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,580
with, with only annual data,

94
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,580
uh, look at, um, you see no data return.

95
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,313
And the reason is,

96
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:33,800
there&#39;s no monthly data on, on staffing.

97
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
I think, I think you could,

98
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:38,760
in the analysis function,

99
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,380
you could set that, I&#39;m getting sidetracked,

100
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,890
but it&#39;s sometimes useful to think about

101
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,140
how you would look at data that is

102
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,120
quarterly or annual.

103
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,390
You&#39;ve got the option in analysis

104
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:57,395
to set the periods to, uh,

105
00:04:57,395 --> 00:05:02,395
you could in theory get custom

106
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,900
that&#39;s how you&#39;d do it, I think.

107
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,790
Uh, multiple,

108
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,210
you could look at multiple years for outliers,

109
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,840
but seldom do you have multiple years of the,

110
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,870
of the human resource data, but okay.

111
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:22,870
Back to, uh, the numerator configuration,

112
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:25,930
I&#39;m gonna pause there.

113
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,340
So, so far we&#39;ve, we&#39;ve talked about

114
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,310
how to fill in the main table

115
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,610
and the role of numerator groups

116
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:37,050
and how to add a numerator group.

117
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,050
You could also remove it from a numerator group.

118
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:44,230
I&#39;m going to remove Physicians from

119
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:46,210
General Service Statistics.

120
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,923
And now it&#39;s only in the Human Resources.

121
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,340
Uh, yeah okay, now, and

122
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,550
General Service Statistics, where are we?

123
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,743
There we are. Okay.

124
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:02,670
You could also,

125
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:07,670
if you decide that you don&#39;t want

126
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,410
the menu to be so full,

127
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:12,820
if you look here after a while,

128
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,763
after you&#39;ve added a whole bunch of uh,

129
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,860
of groups, you, you have a pretty full menu

130
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:27,430
and you might want to simply

131
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,178
remove a group that,

132
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:31,670
that is not on the dashboard.

133
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,210
So you can also do that.

134
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,340
You can delete a group

135
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:39,880
that has no, uh, has no numerators,

136
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,223
which you want to put on the, on the dashboard.
