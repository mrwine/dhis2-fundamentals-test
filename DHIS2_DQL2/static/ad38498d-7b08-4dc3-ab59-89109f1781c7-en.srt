1
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:11,580
- [Norah] The Data Quality App, a hidden gem.

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,580
Part of the sessions on the Data Quality Online Academy.

3
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:24,000
So, some questions about this app.

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,253
Have you seen it?

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,063
Have you used it?

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,180
Do all the analytic users

7
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,923
have access to this app in your country?

8
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,003
Are you sure?

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,543
Go and check.

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,730
So, some of the learning objectives,

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,260
we will look at what is the most common use

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,600
of the Data Quality App,

13
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,450
the value of validation rules,

14
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,810
how to translate validation rules into actual use

15
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,090
and some issues associated with the Data Quality App.

16
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:04,490
They will be no DHIS online training

17
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,790
of how to move your cursor here and what to select there,

18
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,123
you can use the manual.

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,620
So, the DQ App contains the following.

20
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:18,860
It allows you to do a validation rule analysis,

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,670
a standard deviation analysis,

22
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:26,670
a min-max outlier analysis, and a follow-up analysis.

23
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,410
So, let&#39;s talk about validation rules to start.

24
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:34,013
Who&#39;s responsible?

25
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,440
If I talk about validation rules,

26
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:40,570
I sort of get everybody looking away from me.

27
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:43,567
And the feeling is, &quot;Well, you know, they&#39;re not important,

28
00:01:43,567 --> 00:01:44,993
&quot;so it doesn&#39;t matter.

29
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:47,587
&quot;Nobody runs them anyway.

30
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,647
&quot;And if they do, when you find something,

31
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:50,907
&quot;nobody does anything.

32
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:52,277
&quot;You can&#39;t change anything.

33
00:01:52,277 --> 00:01:55,307
&quot;So, why bother to do this?&quot;

34
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,960
If we start with validations,

35
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,560
is we start asking the questions about who&#39;s responsible

36
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:07,460
for thinking about them and then defining them?

37
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,280
Is the person or the people or the group?

38
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,260
Is it the HMIS DHIS2 configuration expert?

39
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,180
Is it a program manager?

40
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,620
Is it a district information officer?

41
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,180
Who has to do the thinking

42
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,823
and the defining and the configuration?

43
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,513
Was it done by one person who takes the responsibility?

44
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,370
Then we ask for who&#39;s responsible for running these rules.

45
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,640
The data entry clerk, the program manager,

46
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,153
facility or district information officer or higher level?

47
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,293
Who&#39;s responsible for running them?

48
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:51,803
If we want to understand the logic of validation rules,

49
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,500
it is a method to assess the quality

50
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,803
of data entered in DHIS2.

51
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:03,370
And these rules are based on a set of predefined rules

52
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,933
set for the data.

53
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:10,270
Unfortunately, the validation rules do not allow you

54
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,100
to fully figure out whether or not the values reported

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,000
are completely accurate.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,890
It is only based on what is in DHIS2.

57
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,230
And if a value is 25,

58
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,920
you don&#39;t know was it 25 clients they saw

59
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,880
and they transferred from the client record

60
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,200
onto the tele sheet onto the input form

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,803
and they captured 25?

62
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,993
You&#39;re just given the 25.

63
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:40,810
So, how do we define a validation rule?

64
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:43,120
We use the term an expression.

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,250
An expression is a relationship

66
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:51,633
between a number of data elements that talk to each other.

67
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,160
This validation rule expression

68
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,700
has a left side, a right side,

69
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,680
and in the middle we have an operator.

70
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,160
And so, some of the common operator used

71
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,893
is less than or equal to,

72
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:11,930
equal to or greater than and equal to.

73
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:16,743
So, some of the operators that we see most commonly.

74
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:21,130
Validation rules are created and based

75
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,383
what you know is true.

76
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,390
Malaria RDT tested cannot be more than malaria RDT positive

77
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:36,173
&#39;cause in order to be RDT positive, you have to be tested.

78
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,230
Another example is live birth

79
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:44,860
weighing less than 2.5 kilogram

80
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,747
cannot be more than live births.

81
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,940
Validation rules are created based on what you know is true.

82
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,030
For instructions on how to set up a validation rule,

83
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,863
read the manual.

84
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:03,650
They&#39;re actually very good

85
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:05,617
and we don&#39;t read them often enough.

86
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,900
Some simple guides to validation rules.

87
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,730
Validation rules are assigned into groups.

88
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,610
This is for analysis.

89
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,650
Validation rules need to be easy to use

90
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,040
and easy to understand.

91
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,050
We use these common operators,

92
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,535
less than, equal to or greater than.

93
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,410
Are we sure that everybody understands

94
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:32,743
what these signs mean and which way the arrow points?

95
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,660
There&#39;s also the importance field of low, medium and high.

96
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:43,260
Have we decided how to assign our validation rules

97
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:46,713
into the importance field or do we just select the default?

98
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,600
Validation rules also need to be consistent.

99
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,840
In other words, the way that they set up and written,

100
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,510
always have the smaller number first.

101
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:01,547
It is easier to understand, it&#39;s intuitively easier

102
00:06:01,547 --> 00:06:06,320
and it makes it easier to grasp the concept.

103
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,750
Validation rules should be run after data entry

104
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:12,770
before the complete button is ticked.

105
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:15,650
Validation rules should also be run after most

106
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,223
or all of the monthly data has been captured.

107
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,570
So, then there are some questions

108
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,690
about who&#39;s responsible for this.

109
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,950
The facility information officer,

110
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,670
the district information officer,

111
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,713
the program officer, the program manager?

112
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,110
Do you have a standard operating procedure

113
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:36,710
to guide the process of running these rules

114
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,023
and taking action?

115
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:42,273
Validation rules, how to define them.

116
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,260
Validation rules is an expression

117
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,930
that defines a relationship

118
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,510
between a number of data elements.

119
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,650
An expression has a left side, a right side,

120
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:54,940
and then in the middle, an operator.

121
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:57,120
So, some of the common operators used

122
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,390
are less than or equal to, equal to

123
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,173
or greater than and equal to.

124
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,310
Validation rules are created

125
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:08,160
based on what you know to be true.

126
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,160
Malaria RDT positive cannot be more than malaria RDT tested.

127
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,820
For instructions on how to set up a validation rule,

128
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:22,133
look in the DHIS2 manual, it&#39;s actually very good.

129
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,660
So, how to run a validation rules.

130
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,357
You select an OrgUnit, you select the time period,

131
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:32,943
you select your group and you click Validate.

132
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,480
Depending on the size of your database

133
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,350
and the number of rules to be run,

134
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,100
became careful in what you select.

135
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,473
Try and avoid crashing the system.

136
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:51,100
Once you have run the validation rules, you get a report

137
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:55,080
which can be downloaded into different formats,

138
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,073
Excel is the easiest.

139
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,200
So, this is the output once you have run the report.

140
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,160
So, on the left, you start off

141
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,000
with the name of your facility,

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,580
the time period, the importance.

143
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,190
Remember, we discussed who decides low, medium, or high.

144
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,740
Then the validation rule, and in this output it&#39;s blank.

145
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,160
Then what is the left value?

146
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,210
What was the operator and the value on the right side?

147
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,993
And then there is a detail icon.

148
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,030
And if you double click on the detail icon,

149
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,560
you will get the rule explained to you.

150
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:36,160
So, this rule says that children five to nine years old

151
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,980
with acute respiratory illness

152
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:43,533
should be greater than or equal to child five to nine years

153
00:08:43,533 --> 00:08:44,823
with pneumonia.

154
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,330
So, the left-hand side,

155
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:51,400
child with symptoms of acute respiratory illness,

156
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,500
five to nine years,

157
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:54,093
there were no children seen.

158
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:59,590
And the right-hand side, of the no children seen,

159
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,013
11 were diagnosed with pneumonia.

160
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,210
When you see something like this,

161
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:10,210
where there is a missing value and then a value,

162
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,920
you need to determine

163
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,900
should the 11 have been the acute respiratory

164
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,208
and the pneumonia?

165
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:21,209
So you actually need to go and find out

166
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:23,450
why is there a missing value

167
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,110
and what is the correct response

168
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,003
to how do you fix this validation rule?

169
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,623
And there are many ways of going about sorting this out.

170
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,280
If you get a list which you download into Excel,

171
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,030
this is what the report will look like,

172
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,320
facility, the time period, the rule,

173
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,430
the lift side, the value, the operator,

174
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:53,370
the value on the right side and the right side description.

175
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,030
And if you&#39;ve downloaded it into Excel,

176
00:09:56,030 --> 00:10:00,130
you can sort it to according to organization units

177
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,220
and you can give to supervisors and program managers

178
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,053
for actions.

179
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:07,583
So this is how you sort out your validation rules.

180
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,400
Then the other,

181
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,513
so this is available in the Data Quality App.

182
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,670
For standard deviation analysis,

183
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:20,690
now we mainly use the WHO DQ Tool

184
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,570
for extreme outliers and missing data.

185
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,260
The min-max outlier analysis.

186
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,700
This you can only use if you have set min-max values,

187
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:34,100
and you need to set them first

188
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,730
and the next presentation will go through that process.

189
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:40,470
And the last aspect in the Data Quality App

190
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,510
is the follow-up analysis.

191
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,080
It&#39;s used to mark data that is correct,

192
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,400
but does not fit the pattern or triggers a validation rule,

193
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,403
and we will have a slide about that.

194
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,080
This is marked for follow-up.

195
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,800
When you double click a value,

196
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,243
you will get a data information window.

197
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:06,950
And top-left hand corner, you have a space for a comment,

198
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,400
and if you click on the star, you can save it.

199
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,843
You highlight the star and you save.

200
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:18,140
And this comment and the star is useful to explain

201
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,583
when the validation rule has been triggered.

202
00:11:22,017 --> 00:11:24,100
It explains why the data doesn&#39;t look

203
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,090
as you want it to look,

204
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:29,913
and then you can run the report on the followup stars.

205
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,003
So, some discussions.

206
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,633
What are the barriers to running validation rules?

207
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:42,993
Have you looked at the data

208
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,905
and set the most possible validation rules?

209
00:11:46,905 --> 00:11:49,300
Have you done everything that could be done?

210
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,770
Do validation rules pick up all the data mistakes?

211
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,150
We&#39;ve spoken about that earlier.

212
00:11:56,150 --> 00:12:00,030
When obvious data entry errors identified,

213
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,193
why are they not corrected?

214
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,863
Who&#39;s responsible for chasing up the data entry errors?

215
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,320
What happens when these errors are not corrected?

216
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,683
What is the result?

217
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,233
So, here are some exercises associated.

218
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:26,900
So, confirm access to the Data Quality App

219
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:30,233
in the country DHIS2 instances.

220
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,870
Obtain a list of all validation rules

221
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,050
and the groups that they fit into.

222
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:40,540
You may have to ask the IT people to help you.

223
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:43,323
Review all your validation rules.

224
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,400
Review them for consistency

225
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,340
in terms of the smaller value first.

226
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,840
We&#39;ve spoken about that.

227
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:56,710
Then I want you to run at least two validation rule groups

228
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,723
for the last six months.

229
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,833
Write a short report on the rules that are violated.

230
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,903
As part of your short report, consider an action plan.

231
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:10,840
Do some rules need to be rewritten

232
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,200
to make them easier to understand?

233
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,233
That could be part of your action plan.

234
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,083
Are some rules being triggered consistently?

235
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:23,419
And is that a problem of data quality

236
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:25,313
or is that a problem with the rule?

237
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,460
And then I want you to think of one rule

238
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,780
that you can add to the current list.

239
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:34,123
Thank you.

240
00:13:34,123 --> 00:13:36,706
