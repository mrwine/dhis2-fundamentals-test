00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:01,430
- [Scott] All right, so in this video

1
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,330
we are going to cover the second part

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,630
of detecting outliers in dashboard

3
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,840
using validation rule notifications.

4
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,200
The way that we&#39;re going to do this

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,240
is by building predictors

6
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,580
and then tying those predictors

7
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,550
to our validation rule notifications,

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,383
but in this video,

9
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:19,763
we&#39;re just going to go over how to configure the predictors.

10
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,650
Before we get into the nitty-gritty of building predictors,

11
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,900
let&#39;s just quickly take a look at some examples

12
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:28,320
of the kinds of outliers

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,880
that we&#39;re going to be able to detect with these predictors

14
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,253
and automatic validation notifications.

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,840
Here is a very common picture

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,940
that we see in a lot of countries.

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,680
We see we have various data elements,

18
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,470
sometimes indicators,

19
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:48,360
progressing over a series of months as a line chart,

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,540
and then we see one month for one of these data values

21
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,510
that is significantly higher than all the others.

22
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,240
You see most of them have a fairly linear trend,

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:03,240
and you see this one peak jutting out right in April 2018.

24
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,570
This is clearly an outlier.

25
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:08,420
This data does not follow the normal trend.

26
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:12,500
This data is so high above the normal accepted value range

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,660
that you can clearly see illustrated here

28
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:19,080
that it&#39;s almost certainly a data quality mistake.

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,370
Now, these kinds of data quality mistakes

30
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,090
can throw off national statistics,

31
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,970
so if every month we&#39;re expecting about 54,000,

32
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,530
in this case BCG doses,

33
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,040
and then, in one month,

34
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,210
you report 170,000 BCG doses.

35
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:37,650
Now, of course, that could be

36
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,663
from a massive, massive outreach campaign,

37
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,500
maybe some door-to-door vaccination efforts,

38
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,990
but by and large,

39
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:50,950
almost always these are going to be data entry errors

40
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,630
where maybe a person at a health facility or a hospital,

41
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,470
maybe they meant to put in 7,000 doses given,

42
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,740
and they put in 70,000 doses given, on accident.

43
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,070
It&#39;s a very easy thing to do.

44
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:06,850
You just add a couple of extra zeros

45
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,910
as you&#39;re putting data in, and you go to the next cell,

46
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,290
and you don&#39;t look back at...

47
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,420
It&#39;s very, very common,

48
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,030
and so we see a clear example of this here,

49
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,700
where you see a very common trend

50
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:22,430
across all these various data elements.

51
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,860
They&#39;re not changing or fluctuating

52
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,240
that much month-to-month,

53
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,290
but one month is really jutting out,

54
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,880
and if we were to leave this data entry error in place,

55
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,760
then, for April 2018,

56
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:38,650
you would probably see that the BCG dose coverage

57
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:42,620
was well over 100%, maybe 200%,

58
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,060
and that would make folks question

59
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,360
the quality and the validity of all of the other data.

60
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,200
If you have one month that&#39;s 200% BCG coverage,

61
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,100
can we trust the rest of the data?

62
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,630
So the point is that it&#39;s very, very important

63
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:00,160
to identify and correct

64
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,830
these kinds of data entry errors,

65
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,410
and the way that we&#39;re going to start showing you

66
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,550
how to do today

67
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:09,060
is have DHIS2 do this for you,

68
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,460
have DHIS2 automatically detect

69
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,170
these kinds of data entry errors,

70
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,550
these kind of data quality problems,

71
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,720
and send you a notification when it has detected them

72
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,480
so that you can correct it immediately.

73
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,630
You do not want these kinds of data entry errors

74
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:25,530
to linger in the system for very long,

75
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,060
so on this slide,

76
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,630
we&#39;re gonna look at just a couple of other examples

77
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,530
of some clear outliers.

78
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:36,100
The chart at the top is looking at BCG doses

79
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,560
to measle one doses dropout rate,

80
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,520
so that is the proportion of children

81
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,400
who are receiving the BCG dose

82
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,233
and then not receiving the first measles dose,

83
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,680
and we expect this to be zero.

84
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,040
We expect them, every single BCG dose,

85
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,130
to be the same value as the measles dose.

86
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:01,640
We expect every person to get both vaccinations,

87
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,150
and we can see that in some org units,

88
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,900
and these bars here are representing org units,

89
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,820
that we have some locations

90
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,030
where the children are receiving

91
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:18,470
significantly higher BCG vaccines

92
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,950
versus measles vaccines.

93
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,330
Now, of course, this should not be the case.

94
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,030
We should always see that the number of BCG vaccines

95
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,990
are the same as the number of measles vaccines.

96
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,490
This top chart is showing us

97
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:37,250
the BCG-to-measles-one-dose dropout rate,

98
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,630
and what we expect to see

99
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,680
is that the number of BCG doses given

100
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,803
is equal to the number of measles doses given.

101
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,800
Here, on the top chart, we have a target line of zero.

102
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,910
Again, that&#39;s indicative of the BCG vaccines

103
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,240
doses given should equal the measles.

104
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,490
We should be a one-to-one relationship there.

105
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,740
Then we&#39;re giving ourselves

106
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:07,740
an acceptable maximum range of 20%,

107
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,600
and that means that we are allowing,

108
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,100
in this particular country scenario,

109
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,700
a dropout rate of 20%

110
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,460
from BCG vaccine to measles one,

111
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:21,730
meaning that 20% of the children

112
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,780
who got the BCG vaccine

113
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,070
will not get the measles one dose,

114
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,740
and they&#39;re saying that that&#39;s an acceptable range,

115
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,683
of course, not ideal, but an acceptable range,

116
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,230
but you see we have two bars here.

117
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:39,530
These bars are representing health facilities

118
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,000
where we have a 72.1% dropout rate

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,780
and a 73.4% dropout rate.

120
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,800
Now, what does this mean?

121
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,790
This means that

122
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:51,777
we have 72.1

123
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:53,824
and 73.4%

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,320
of the children who received the BCG vaccine

125
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,310
not receiving the measles vaccine.

126
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,520
Now, obviously, this is a big problem.

127
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,380
This is either a data quality mistake,

128
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:09,650
or this is some kind of breakdown

129
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:11,700
in clinical service delivery.

130
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:14,193
We should never see a dropout rate this high,

131
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,707
so this is telling this program manager that,

132
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:23,097
&quot;Hey, we&#39;ve got problems in these two health facilities

133
00:06:23,097 --> 00:06:25,427
&quot;in that the majority of children

134
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:27,347
&quot;who are receiving the BCG vaccine

135
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:30,037
&quot;are then not receiving the measles,

136
00:06:30,037 --> 00:06:31,970
&quot;and so I need to follow up.&quot;

137
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,590
Hopefully, in this scenario,

138
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:36,250
you find that it&#39;s a data quality problem.

139
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:37,830
If it&#39;s not a data quality problem,

140
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,350
then you have some serious problems

141
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:42,010
with your measles one doses

142
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,453
in these two health facilities,

143
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,300
so those are the bars

144
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:50,330
that are going above the acceptable maximum range.

145
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,370
Let&#39;s look, now, though, at these few bars

146
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:57,940
that are going below the zero target line,

147
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,773
so they&#39;re going down.

148
00:06:58,773 --> 00:06:59,790
These are negative values,

149
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,450
and we see that there are two here

150
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,360
that are really quite big.

151
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,260
We have one that&#39;s negative 74.5

152
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,790
and one that&#39;s negative 271.4.

153
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,540
What does this mean?

154
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,670
This essentially means

155
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:17,020
that we have more children receiving the measles vaccine

156
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,703
than we have receiving the BCG vaccine.

157
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,130
Now, that is extremely unusual,

158
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,630
basically, impossible from a clinical perspective.

159
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:30,820
This is almost certainly a data-quality issue

160
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,220
in these two health facilities

161
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,130
where the bar is going lower

162
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,170
than the target line,

163
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:39,830
and you see that we actually have three others,

164
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,040
health facilities that are reporting

165
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,750
that the measles one is higher than the BCG.

166
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,650
Now, there should be an acceptable range for this, too.

167
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,970
We appreciate that in many countries

168
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,890
you&#39;re reporting on two different cohorts of children

169
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:56,973
between the BCG vaccine and the measles one vaccine.

170
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:00,720
Maybe you have some kind of seasonal birth

171
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,043
patterns or trends in your country,

172
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,120
but a value of negative 74.5

173
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,940
and negative 271.4

174
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,730
should be considered extremely unacceptable

175
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,660
no matter how much

176
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,710
seasonality you have to your birth rates in your country.

177
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,300
It&#39;s basically guaranteed

178
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,420
that these are data quality problems,

179
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,240
that someone accidentally put in

180
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:35,520
far too few BCG vaccines

181
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:39,530
or far too many measles one doses,

182
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,750
so these are definitely something

183
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,390
that needs to be followed up on,

184
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,020
and the point of this chart at the top here

185
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,020
is showing you that you can see these

186
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,740
very, very, very clearly,

187
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,470
these bars that are way too high,

188
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,870
and these bars that are way too low,

189
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,440
and you&#39;re going to be able, if you&#39;re looking at this,

190
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,800
if you&#39;re a program manager,

191
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,140
to immediately follow up on these.

192
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:02,233
They should be as obvious as they possibly can be.

193
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,410
Again, examples of outliers,

194
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,563
especially that negative 271.4, an extreme outlier.

195
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:16,030
All right, let&#39;s take a look at the next chart below this.

196
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,440
This next chart below this

197
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,300
is looking at new malaria cases, under five,

198
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:26,773
versus new malaria cases, five and above.

199
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,120
The under five are showing up here

200
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:34,870
as the green portion of these stacked column,

201
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:37,783
or excuse me, this is a stacked bar chart,

202
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:41,560
and the blue portion is showing

203
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,620
the five-and-above proportion of the population

204
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,710
in this stacked bar chart,

205
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:51,400
and you see that we have set our range

206
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:55,340
for this chart to be up to 100%,

207
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,970
so here we have, essentially, a clear representation

208
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:03,550
of the proportion of total new malaria cases

209
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:08,313
being disaggregated by under five and over five.

210
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:13,180
Now, we expect, in most countries

211
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,490
that have malaria,

212
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,580
to have about 30%

213
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,560
of our new malaria cases

214
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,683
to be under five, okay?

215
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,170
That&#39;s a very, very common trend

216
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,120
that we see around the world where we have endemic malaria,

217
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:38,093
so you see that at the 30% line, that&#39;s what we have.

218
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:43,250
We have a black line going through 30%

219
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,080
that says expected range under five, minimum.

220
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,140
Now, we&#39;re giving ourselves a little bit of a buffer

221
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,660
because it can vary based upon your population distribution

222
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,100
in terms of age,

223
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,830
but we then give ourselves

224
00:10:56,830 --> 00:11:00,957
an acceptable upper range of 35%,

225
00:11:00,957 --> 00:11:03,520
and you see, again, at the 35% line,

226
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,720
we have a strong black line cutting through that,

227
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,790
and it&#39;s telling us that between 30 and 35%,

228
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,190
we should see

229
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:17,370
that under-five population end

230
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:21,313
and the over-five population begin.

231
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:27,550
Now, what you see here, if you look through the months,

232
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,030
kind of going from top to bottom as you scan through,

233
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,763
you see that in November 2018,

234
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,180
our new malaria cases under five

235
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,263
are around 65%.

236
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,630
You see that green at November 2018.

237
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,980
You see that green line

238
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:53,960
going way, way, way, way past the acceptable ranges

239
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,640
and going far into what, in the other months,

240
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,203
is just the blue, just the over five,

241
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:07,300
and this is another clear indication of an outlier,

242
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:09,930
so November 2018,

243
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,010
there is clearly an outlier

244
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:16,030
in your new malaria cases under five.

245
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:20,093
Someone accidentally put in a value that was way too big,

246
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,200
and you can see

247
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,550
that it&#39;s throwing off our national statistics.

248
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:27,910
It&#39;s throwing off our national distribution

249
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,000
and disaggregation of our age breakdown

250
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,910
of the new malaria cases,

251
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,800
so if you were to look at this,

252
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,140
you would say that somehow, in November 2018,

253
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,280
65% of our malaria cases

254
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,063
were under-five population.

255
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:50,623
Now, that&#39;s just not clinically possible.

256
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,410
I can&#39;t even imagine a scenario

257
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,490
in which that&#39;s clinically possible,

258
00:12:57,490 --> 00:13:00,850
so that means that you have an outlier.

259
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:04,820
You have a data quality problem in November 2018,

260
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:09,480
and if you look at the values that we have reported

261
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,680
for our new under-five cases,

262
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,373
most months, they&#39;re ranging between,

263
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,650
they&#39;re ranging between

264
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:24,180
about 100,000,

265
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,963
maybe 150,000, something like that,

266
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,920
but here, in November 2018,

267
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,363
we&#39;re up above nearly, we&#39;re nearly 300,000 cases.

268
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:42,110
Whereas our over five is still

269
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,400
in the acceptable average that we&#39;re seeing,

270
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,233
and, of course,

271
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:46,790
you have to appreciate that malaria&#39;s seasonal,

272
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,240
so it&#39;s going to,

273
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,843
what we&#39;re not seeing here is the seasonal curve,

274
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:54,470
but we&#39;re still seeing

275
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,530
that the proportion is way out of whack.

276
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,590
It&#39;s just not possible,

277
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,930
so again, another clear indication of a outlier.

278
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,820
The point of these two charts, really,

279
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,750
is to show that we can see outliers

280
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:09,290
in a lot of different ways, right?

281
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:10,130
In the first chart,

282
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:12,540
we saw that we can see an outlier stick up

283
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,653
in a kind of month-to-month trend.

284
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,150
Here, on the first chart here,

285
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:23,120
we&#39;re able to see that outliers being illustrated

286
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:27,810
by a relationship between two different data elements,

287
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,293
so, for example, here,

288
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:32,700
a BCG-to-measles-one-dose dropout rate,

289
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,870
so we&#39;re comparing these two data elements together

290
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,640
to see outliers in one or the other,

291
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:42,200
and then, on this malaria example in this bottom chart,

292
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,370
we&#39;re seeing outliers represented

293
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,110
by disaggregations

294
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,910
of our clinical data by age.

295
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,913
You maybe also can do this by gender,

296
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,650
and so these are just to show you

297
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,030
that we can find outliers in a lot of ways,

298
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:02,510
but this requires you to look at the dashboards,

299
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,760
to look at your charts, to have these,

300
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:07,343
that you&#39;re routinely looking at them.

301
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,870
Of course, people are not always

302
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,460
routinely looking at their DHIS2 dashboards,

303
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,700
and so the most effective way

304
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,640
to make sure that people address these kinds of outliers

305
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,230
that are throwing off national statistics

306
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:23,810
is to configure DHIS2 to be able to automatically detect it

307
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:28,120
and to send a notification to the user who can correct it.

308
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,700
Okay, so let&#39;s take,

309
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,530
just before we get into the crazy predictor stuff,

310
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:34,390
let&#39;s just do a quick overview of

311
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:37,630
how do we identify these outliers on a standard dashboard

312
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:41,170
and isolate the actual outlier itself?

313
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,680
Well, we have some steps for this,

314
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,740
and I&#39;m gonna show these to you just in a second.

315
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:48,923
The first step is that we want to isolate the period.

316
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:53,310
Usually, we just wanna drill into one month.

317
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:56,330
Then we want to change the chart type to a bar chart.

318
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,990
Then we need to isolate the data element.

319
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,110
Then we need to isolate the facility level

320
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,940
to see where the data is coming from,

321
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,370
and then we change the layout

322
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:07,020
so that org units is in category, period&#39;s in filter,

323
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,210
and data is in series.

324
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:10,100
Now, I just did that really fast.

325
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,040
Let me just show it to you in real life here,

326
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,170
so I&#39;m going to go to the demo site

327
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,173
for the academies.

328
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,620
Here we are.

329
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:27,210
I&#39;m going to log in as demo

330
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,567
and then District1#.

331
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:37,946
- [Scott] Yeah, okay, so here we have a similar chart

332
00:16:37,946 --> 00:16:39,246
to what I just showed you,

333
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:43,526
and I think even Bob mentioned this in the videos.

334
00:16:43,526 --> 00:16:44,586
Where is the outlier here?

335
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,366
Well, there&#39;s probably two outliers:

336
00:16:46,366 --> 00:16:50,116
This point here, back May 2019, ANC first visits,

337
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:52,766
and this one here, ANC first visits

338
00:16:54,756 --> 00:16:57,566
from January 2020.

339
00:16:57,566 --> 00:17:01,026
Now, how do we figure out where this data is coming from?

340
00:17:01,026 --> 00:17:04,286
Where&#39;s the facility that&#39;s causing this outlier, right?

341
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:06,486
Now we need to do a quick recap

342
00:17:06,486 --> 00:17:08,666
of how to use the Data Visualizer app,

343
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:09,516
so what I&#39;m gonna do

344
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,516
is just show you the whole process here.

345
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:16,446
I am going to, I can&#39;t explore this on the dashboard,

346
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:20,519
so I&#39;m going to click the Open In Visualizer App button,

347
00:17:21,596 --> 00:17:22,546
and that&#39;s gonna take me

348
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:25,436
into the Data Visualizer application,

349
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:26,856
so now we&#39;re in the application,

350
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:29,226
and we could start to drill into this data.

351
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:30,566
What was my first step?

352
00:17:30,566 --> 00:17:33,276
My first step was to isolate the periods,

353
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:37,016
so we know that the outlier&#39;s in January 2020.

354
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:39,876
I am going to go to my period selection.

355
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:41,359
I&#39;m going to deselect all these periods.

356
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:43,796
You see we have 13 months here selected.

357
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,206
I&#39;m gonna deselect these.

358
00:17:45,206 --> 00:17:46,886
I&#39;m gonna go to fixed periods,

359
00:17:46,886 --> 00:17:50,086
and I&#39;m gonna say January 2020.

360
00:17:50,086 --> 00:17:53,526
Turn that one on, and here we go.

361
00:17:53,526 --> 00:17:57,206
Just some dots because we have a trend line,

362
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:58,956
but we don&#39;t have a trend if it&#39;s just one period.

363
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:01,289
Here&#39;s still my outlier, way up here.

364
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:05,056
Then we need to change the chart type to a bar chart,

365
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,816
so I&#39;m gonna go over here to the chart types.

366
00:18:07,816 --> 00:18:08,966
Change it to a column.

367
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:10,126
You could also change it to bar.

368
00:18:10,126 --> 00:18:12,796
I&#39;m gonna choose column, and there we go,

369
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:15,336
so now we actually see all the data next to each other,

370
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:17,946
and still, here&#39;s our outlier, all right?

371
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:20,716
Now we want to isolate that data element,

372
00:18:20,716 --> 00:18:23,916
that data element that has the outliers ANC first visits,

373
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,756
so I&#39;m gonna come to data,

374
00:18:25,756 --> 00:18:27,816
and I&#39;m gonna turn off everything

375
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,799
that&#39;s not ANC first visits.

376
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:34,726
Click Update. Boom.

377
00:18:34,726 --> 00:18:37,849
Now we just got one big bar. That&#39;s fine.

378
00:18:39,006 --> 00:18:40,036
Now let&#39;s figure out

379
00:18:40,036 --> 00:18:41,996
where this data is actually coming from.

380
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,406
Now, the easiest way to do that

381
00:18:43,406 --> 00:18:46,846
is to go into our organizational units,

382
00:18:46,846 --> 00:18:48,246
and you see right now I have

383
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:53,086
the relative User Organization Units tick box selected.

384
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:54,646
I&#39;m going to untick that.

385
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:57,736
I&#39;m going to select National level, or the National,

386
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:58,996
and then I&#39;m gonna select my level,

387
00:18:58,996 --> 00:18:59,829
and I&#39;m gonna go ahead

388
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:04,006
and go all the way down to Facility level, okay?

389
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:06,436
So that&#39;s gonna show me all of the facilities.

390
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:08,546
Click update. Nothing changed.

391
00:19:08,546 --> 00:19:09,526
Why did nothing change?

392
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:11,646
Because my layout is not correct,

393
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:13,866
so the last step is to change the layout.

394
00:19:13,866 --> 00:19:18,816
We are going to move organizational units to category.

395
00:19:18,816 --> 00:19:21,656
We are going to move period to filter,

396
00:19:21,656 --> 00:19:23,096
which automatically went for us

397
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:25,856
when we switched out with the org units,

398
00:19:25,856 --> 00:19:27,596
and we&#39;re going to leave

399
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,496
data in series.

400
00:19:31,496 --> 00:19:34,416
Click Update. Boom.

401
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:37,136
Where is that outlier? Well, it is clear.

402
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:38,686
This is right here.

403
00:19:38,686 --> 00:19:41,476
Outlier is at facility 147,

404
00:19:41,476 --> 00:19:45,593
and in one month, they reported 35,888

405
00:19:45,593 --> 00:19:49,186
ANC first visits, okay?

406
00:19:49,186 --> 00:19:52,296
This is how you isolate for the outliers

407
00:19:52,296 --> 00:19:56,296
going from a dashboard and through the Data Visualizer.

408
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:58,686
A few steps here, right?

409
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:01,586
You also have to know how to use the Data Visualizer.

410
00:20:01,586 --> 00:20:03,116
Now, wouldn&#39;t it be nice

411
00:20:03,116 --> 00:20:07,296
if this notification was just sent directly to my e-mail?

412
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:08,376
How do we do that?

413
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:11,186
Well, that&#39;s what we&#39;re gonna talk about now.

414
00:20:11,186 --> 00:20:13,886
How do we see this outlier sent directly to my e-mail?

415
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:17,426
I know I just went through that quite quickly.

416
00:20:17,426 --> 00:20:22,216
If you want to revisit how I just gone through

417
00:20:22,216 --> 00:20:24,036
and use the applications and the dashboards

418
00:20:24,036 --> 00:20:25,516
to identify this outlier,

419
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,396
please go back and rewatch this presentation,

420
00:20:28,396 --> 00:20:31,296
and you&#39;re certainly welcome to slow it down if necessary.

421
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,066
All right, and again,

422
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:43,096
I showed this example just before the break,

423
00:20:43,096 --> 00:20:47,116
but Rwanda has at least configured some to do this,

424
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:51,786
at least partially, to automatically detect the outliers,

425
00:20:51,786 --> 00:20:54,739
and send them, and push them to people&#39;s, to e-mails.

426
00:20:59,036 --> 00:21:00,816
All right, so the way

427
00:21:00,816 --> 00:21:03,246
that we actually calculate the outlier threshold,

428
00:21:03,246 --> 00:21:06,666
and, again, we have to compare the data that is entered

429
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:09,536
against an outlier threshold.

430
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,816
The way that we actually calculate that outlier threshold

431
00:21:11,816 --> 00:21:13,426
is using predictors,

432
00:21:13,426 --> 00:21:16,909
and we put that predicted value into a validation rule.

433
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:19,336
Predictors...

434
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:27,556
Right, so predictors have typically only been used

435
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:32,346
for data elements in DHIS 2.28 to 2.34.

436
00:21:32,346 --> 00:21:34,016
Starting in 2.35,

437
00:21:34,016 --> 00:21:36,716
we can actually start to do some of this analysis,

438
00:21:36,716 --> 00:21:39,916
not using predictors, but using indicators,

439
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,766
so the release that we actually just put out yesterday,

440
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:45,036
you can start to use this and standard indicators,

441
00:21:45,036 --> 00:21:46,786
but most of you, basically, all of you

442
00:21:46,786 --> 00:21:48,136
because we released it yesterday,

443
00:21:48,136 --> 00:21:49,766
are not using 2.35 yet.

444
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:50,976
I&#39;m gonna show you how to do it

445
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,069
in 2.28 to 2.34.

446
00:22:03,526 --> 00:22:08,109
So let&#39;s take a look at some of these predictors.

447
00:22:14,156 --> 00:22:16,406
What are these calculations for?

448
00:22:16,406 --> 00:22:19,656
So predictors really use

449
00:22:19,656 --> 00:22:21,996
previously reported values.

450
00:22:21,996 --> 00:22:23,706
They use previously reported values

451
00:22:23,706 --> 00:22:27,326
to calculate a new value, all right?

452
00:22:27,326 --> 00:22:29,226
That&#39;s really what predictors are for,

453
00:22:30,136 --> 00:22:32,986
and we can, a couple of examples of this,

454
00:22:32,986 --> 00:22:35,136
so the first example:

455
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:37,546
I want to get the average malaria incidence

456
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:40,226
over the last six months, right?

457
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:42,936
You can&#39;t use a standard indicator for that.

458
00:22:42,936 --> 00:22:45,156
You cannot use,

459
00:22:45,156 --> 00:22:46,386
the only thing that you can use

460
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:49,189
to calculate that value in DHIS2 is a predictor.

461
00:22:50,426 --> 00:22:51,906
Another example: I wanna calculate

462
00:22:51,906 --> 00:22:54,916
the average ART consumption over the last three months.

463
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:56,256
Maybe you&#39;re using DHIS2

464
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:58,296
for some kind of supply chain monitoring,

465
00:22:58,296 --> 00:23:00,086
and using predictors,

466
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:02,936
you would be able to calculate, say, average consumption.

467
00:23:04,586 --> 00:23:08,556
Next point: I want to see the average ANC visits

468
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:10,686
with three standard deviations,

469
00:23:10,686 --> 00:23:11,519
&#39;member, we talked about

470
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:13,316
what standard deviations were yesterday,

471
00:23:13,316 --> 00:23:15,046
for the last 12 months.

472
00:23:15,046 --> 00:23:18,666
This would produce an ANC 1 outlier threshold.

473
00:23:18,666 --> 00:23:19,499
This is really the,

474
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:21,276
actually, what we&#39;re gonna be building now.

475
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:25,626
We want to see what is the outlier threshold,

476
00:23:25,626 --> 00:23:27,346
and the way we calculate that is

477
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:31,536
we want three standard deviations from the average

478
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,269
over the last 12 months.

479
00:23:34,586 --> 00:23:37,256
Predictors can also be used,

480
00:23:37,256 --> 00:23:40,176
the next bullet point, the fourth bullet point here,

481
00:23:40,176 --> 00:23:41,866
predictors can also be used

482
00:23:41,866 --> 00:23:45,716
to count the number of facilities that report some value.

483
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:49,166
This is a very, very highly requested

484
00:23:49,166 --> 00:23:51,376
indicator in DHIS2,

485
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:53,726
and even though we&#39;re not,

486
00:23:53,726 --> 00:23:56,416
it&#39;s not related to data quality, necessarily,

487
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,006
I just wanna make the point clear

488
00:23:58,006 --> 00:24:00,496
that using predictors, you can count the number

489
00:24:00,496 --> 00:24:03,706
of org units that did something,

490
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:05,856
so I wanna know every org unit

491
00:24:05,856 --> 00:24:08,986
that recorded more than five malaria cases

492
00:24:08,986 --> 00:24:12,146
or how many org units recorded more than five malaria cases.

493
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,896
Well, you can actually get that number

494
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:16,819
using predictors from aggregate data.

495
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:23,536
A couple of words of warning here.

496
00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:25,736
Predictors have to be scheduled jobs.

497
00:24:25,736 --> 00:24:27,516
Just like we talked about scheduling jobs

498
00:24:27,516 --> 00:24:28,886
and validation rules,

499
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:31,416
predictors have to be scheduled jobs.

500
00:24:31,416 --> 00:24:35,186
Predictors do also require quite a lot of processing

501
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:37,616
on your CPU, on your servers,

502
00:24:37,616 --> 00:24:40,209
so if you have a lot of that predictors running,

503
00:24:42,156 --> 00:24:45,006
quite often, you can really tax your server,

504
00:24:45,006 --> 00:24:46,896
just like we talked about with validation rules,

505
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:48,256
so you have to be very careful

506
00:24:48,256 --> 00:24:51,766
about how many predictors you have run, when they run,

507
00:24:51,766 --> 00:24:54,126
and how much data they actually generate

508
00:24:54,126 --> 00:24:56,143
because these could all have server (stammers).

509
00:24:58,417 --> 00:25:00,536
They could all affect your server. Excuse me.

510
00:25:00,536 --> 00:25:01,946
If you are a server expert

511
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:04,206
or a server administrator out there,

512
00:25:04,206 --> 00:25:05,666
please feel free to talk to us

513
00:25:05,666 --> 00:25:07,916
about exactly how you should be considering

514
00:25:07,916 --> 00:25:11,346
how many predictors to run, when to run them,

515
00:25:11,346 --> 00:25:12,726
how much data to store

516
00:25:13,586 --> 00:25:16,626
because if you just set these up

517
00:25:16,626 --> 00:25:19,126
without considering how your server is performing,

518
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:21,426
you could really set yourself up for disaster,

519
00:25:24,016 --> 00:25:26,159
so how do we make a predictor?

520
00:25:27,036 --> 00:25:28,936
Well, predictors are actually,

521
00:25:28,936 --> 00:25:31,396
the value that&#39;s generated through a predictor

522
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:35,916
is actually stored as a data element in DHIS2,

523
00:25:35,916 --> 00:25:40,106
and the reason that this is good or is useful

524
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:43,566
is that that data element can then be used in indicators.

525
00:25:43,566 --> 00:25:46,656
It can be used in validation rules.

526
00:25:46,656 --> 00:25:50,426
It can be used in anywhere that you use a data element,

527
00:25:50,426 --> 00:25:52,966
so again, predictors are very different

528
00:25:52,966 --> 00:25:54,776
than standard indicators.

529
00:25:54,776 --> 00:25:58,266
Standard indicators calculate values on the fly.

530
00:25:58,266 --> 00:25:59,856
They do not store those values.

531
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:01,546
They just, every time you turn on an indicator,

532
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:03,836
that value&#39;s calculated, right?

533
00:26:03,836 --> 00:26:06,796
Predictors actually calculate the value

534
00:26:06,796 --> 00:26:10,336
and then store that value as a data element

535
00:26:10,336 --> 00:26:13,136
so that you can go back and use it in other places,

536
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:14,496
so how do we do this?

537
00:26:14,496 --> 00:26:17,196
We first make a data element.

538
00:26:17,196 --> 00:26:19,246
Then we make the predictor,

539
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:21,156
and we assign that predictor

540
00:26:21,156 --> 00:26:25,086
to store that value that it generates in the data element.

541
00:26:25,086 --> 00:26:27,436
Then, just like with indicators and data elements,

542
00:26:27,436 --> 00:26:30,026
we have to put the predictor in a predictor group.

543
00:26:30,026 --> 00:26:32,546
Then we schedule the predictor group to run,

544
00:26:32,546 --> 00:26:34,996
just like we did with the validation rules,

545
00:26:34,996 --> 00:26:37,076
and then, finally, we can put that predictor

546
00:26:37,076 --> 00:26:38,856
into a validation rule

547
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:41,929
to allow us to get those outlier detection going,

548
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:47,806
so how do we make the outlier threshold?

549
00:26:47,806 --> 00:26:50,296
Well, the first step

550
00:26:50,296 --> 00:26:54,176
is that you have to make your data element,

551
00:26:54,176 --> 00:26:56,836
and so I&#39;m going to quickly cover how to make data elements.

552
00:26:56,836 --> 00:27:01,276
This is not a DHIS2 configuration course, specifically,

553
00:27:01,276 --> 00:27:05,336
but you have to make the data element first,

554
00:27:05,336 --> 00:27:07,526
and this is the screen to make a data element.

555
00:27:07,526 --> 00:27:08,716
Again, you go to your Maintenance app.

556
00:27:08,716 --> 00:27:09,736
You click Data Elements.

557
00:27:09,736 --> 00:27:10,996
You click the plus button,

558
00:27:10,996 --> 00:27:13,366
and then you&#39;re into making a data element.

559
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:16,136
You have to give your data element a name, of course.

560
00:27:16,136 --> 00:27:17,706
You also have to give it a short name.

561
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:19,856
Typically, the short name is the same as the long name.

562
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:20,689
In this case,

563
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:24,406
we&#39;re saying ANC1 Outlier Threshold, hyphen, your name,

564
00:27:24,406 --> 00:27:26,166
and again, you&#39;re putting your, hyphen, your name

565
00:27:26,166 --> 00:27:27,716
in case you&#39;re doing this right now.

566
00:27:27,716 --> 00:27:28,876
You&#39;re following along.

567
00:27:28,876 --> 00:27:33,476
You&#39;re able to recognize your outlier threshold

568
00:27:33,476 --> 00:27:36,456
from anyone else who&#39;s making theirs right now.

569
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:39,026
Your domain type will be set to aggregate,

570
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:40,876
your value type set to number,

571
00:27:40,876 --> 00:27:43,189
and your aggregation type set to sum.

572
00:27:46,436 --> 00:27:50,336
Then we need to go in and make the predictor,

573
00:27:50,336 --> 00:27:53,149
so again, we go to Maintenance app.

574
00:27:54,642 --> 00:27:55,836
We scroll all the way down

575
00:27:55,836 --> 00:27:57,456
to the bottom of the Maintenance app.

576
00:27:57,456 --> 00:27:59,766
You&#39;ll see the predictors there.

577
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:00,746
You&#39;ll click on the predictor,

578
00:28:00,746 --> 00:28:02,906
and you can click that blue plus button again,

579
00:28:02,906 --> 00:28:05,336
and you&#39;ll go into making the predictor.

580
00:28:05,336 --> 00:28:07,476
The screen you see here is actually how,

581
00:28:07,476 --> 00:28:10,429
is the screen you would build the predictor in.

582
00:28:11,946 --> 00:28:14,449
Again, first step, as always, give it a name.

583
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,506
Second step is, of course,

584
00:28:17,506 --> 00:28:19,516
you can also give it a short name, and a code,

585
00:28:19,516 --> 00:28:20,996
and a description as well,

586
00:28:20,996 --> 00:28:25,686
but the second compulsory step is to define the output,

587
00:28:25,686 --> 00:28:28,136
so we just made a data element.

588
00:28:28,136 --> 00:28:31,406
We need to go in and find that data element we just made

589
00:28:31,406 --> 00:28:34,476
and assign that data element to this predictor,

590
00:28:34,476 --> 00:28:36,316
and just to repeat myself,

591
00:28:36,316 --> 00:28:40,026
the predictor will store the value that is generated

592
00:28:40,026 --> 00:28:43,996
in that data element, okay?

593
00:28:43,996 --> 00:28:46,106
We also have to define a period type,

594
00:28:46,106 --> 00:28:49,456
so at what frequency will,

595
00:28:49,456 --> 00:28:50,886
so the frequency was (indistinct) run,

596
00:28:50,886 --> 00:28:53,806
but how will that aggregated value

597
00:28:53,806 --> 00:28:55,706
in that data element be stored?

598
00:28:55,706 --> 00:28:58,209
And we&#39;re gonna say monthly here,

599
00:28:59,466 --> 00:29:03,316
and then, the next step, which is absolutely required,

600
00:29:03,316 --> 00:29:05,596
but it does not have an asterisk next to it,

601
00:29:05,596 --> 00:29:07,596
and so please hear me.

602
00:29:07,596 --> 00:29:10,946
You have to select an organizational unit group level,

603
00:29:10,946 --> 00:29:13,376
or sorry, organizational unit level.

604
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,216
You have to select

605
00:29:14,216 --> 00:29:16,946
an organizational unit level for predictors,

606
00:29:16,946 --> 00:29:20,806
so here, the typical rule of thumb is

607
00:29:20,806 --> 00:29:24,556
select the level at which the data is captured

608
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:27,146
against the values that will be used

609
00:29:27,146 --> 00:29:29,326
to calculate your predictor.

610
00:29:29,326 --> 00:29:31,136
Select that same level,

611
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:35,456
so in this case, ANC data is coming in at facility level,

612
00:29:35,456 --> 00:29:37,756
so I want my predictor,

613
00:29:37,756 --> 00:29:39,686
I want the value that is generated

614
00:29:39,686 --> 00:29:42,446
to also be stored at facility level,

615
00:29:42,446 --> 00:29:45,426
so I&#39;m selecting facility here, okay?

616
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:48,656
So please, you have to select an organizational unit level.

617
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:51,129
If you don&#39;t, the predictor will not work.

618
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,186
The next step

619
00:29:55,186 --> 00:29:59,529
is to define your generator, okay?

620
00:30:05,626 --> 00:30:07,196
In the generator,

621
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:10,486
this is where you actually put in the calculation

622
00:30:10,486 --> 00:30:11,499
for the predictor,

623
00:30:13,586 --> 00:30:14,826
and in the generator,

624
00:30:14,826 --> 00:30:17,626
you first have to define a missing value strategy.

625
00:30:17,626 --> 00:30:20,626
This is the same as the validation rules,

626
00:30:20,626 --> 00:30:24,519
and it will just say if the values that are missing,

627
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:27,516
how do I handle the values that are missing

628
00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:29,566
in the calculation that you&#39;re providing?

629
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:36,996
The default is skip any values if it&#39;s missing,

630
00:30:36,996 --> 00:30:41,806
and the question is, is this usually good?

631
00:30:41,806 --> 00:30:46,326
And typically, with predictors, it&#39;s not useful.

632
00:30:46,326 --> 00:30:48,336
We actually want the calculation,

633
00:30:48,336 --> 00:30:50,479
even if there are some values missing,

634
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:54,136
and the reason is for that

635
00:30:54,136 --> 00:30:57,236
because we still wanna calculate this value.

636
00:30:57,236 --> 00:31:00,286
This value&#39;s actually referencing previously reported data,

637
00:31:00,286 --> 00:31:02,206
so even if, and in this case,

638
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:03,076
we&#39;re actually gonna be looking

639
00:31:03,076 --> 00:31:05,586
at 12 previous months of data,

640
00:31:05,586 --> 00:31:09,236
so if we leave it to skip if all values are missing

641
00:31:09,236 --> 00:31:11,156
or skip if any values are missing,

642
00:31:11,156 --> 00:31:14,136
then, if it skip if any values are missing,

643
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:17,606
then if there&#39;s one month of where there is no data,

644
00:31:17,606 --> 00:31:20,736
then we won&#39;t actually generate our predictor,

645
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:21,706
and that&#39;s not what we want.

646
00:31:21,706 --> 00:31:24,656
We actually want them to generate the predicted value

647
00:31:24,656 --> 00:31:26,656
for the average over the last 12 months

648
00:31:26,656 --> 00:31:28,226
even if there is one of those months

649
00:31:28,226 --> 00:31:29,526
that doesn&#39;t have a value.

650
00:31:31,216 --> 00:31:33,186
Okay, again, I think this is something

651
00:31:33,186 --> 00:31:35,466
that&#39;s easier to show you than to

652
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:40,156
to talk about on a slide,

653
00:31:40,156 --> 00:31:43,329
so I am gonna go into my Maintenance app.

654
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:53,166
I&#39;m gonna scroll all the way down to predictors.

655
00:31:57,956 --> 00:32:00,209
I&#39;m gonna go into my generator.

656
00:32:02,306 --> 00:32:03,286
All right, and remember,

657
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:06,126
we&#39;re making a predictor that is going to produce

658
00:32:06,126 --> 00:32:10,086
an outlier threshold for ANC 1,

659
00:32:10,086 --> 00:32:13,276
so again, how do we calculate an outlier threshold?

660
00:32:13,276 --> 00:32:16,216
Well, the outlier threshold is the average

661
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:21,386
plus three standard deviations

662
00:32:23,596 --> 00:32:24,429
of the value,

663
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:26,416
so how do we do that?

664
00:32:26,416 --> 00:32:29,436
Well, in predictors,

665
00:32:29,436 --> 00:32:33,699
we are allowed to type in various mathematical operators.

666
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,976
If you&#39;re curious on what all of these operators are,

667
00:32:36,976 --> 00:32:37,916
I think I have a slide on it,

668
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:40,756
but you can also just Google DHIS2 predictors,

669
00:32:40,756 --> 00:32:43,676
and there is a clear documentation on all the various ones,

670
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:46,636
but for the ones

671
00:32:46,636 --> 00:32:48,783
that we&#39;re gonna use right now is AVG,

672
00:32:51,096 --> 00:32:53,356
and then, that&#39;s the average,

673
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:55,416
and then we&#39;re gonna find ANC 1,

674
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:59,299
and I&#39;m just gonna say ANC 1 visits.

675
00:33:00,806 --> 00:33:02,309
Close my,

676
00:33:04,226 --> 00:33:07,446
sorry, close my brackets,

677
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,426
and you see my translator&#39;s already working,

678
00:33:09,426 --> 00:33:11,539
so I&#39;m taking the average of ANC 1,

679
00:33:12,736 --> 00:33:13,569
plus

680
00:33:17,166 --> 00:33:20,096
I&#39;m gonna do another open bracket,

681
00:33:20,096 --> 00:33:23,466
three times

682
00:33:24,366 --> 00:33:26,039
the standard deviation,

683
00:33:27,016 --> 00:33:30,959
and standard deviation is typed S-T-D-D-E-V,

684
00:33:32,526 --> 00:33:34,359
another open brackets.

685
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,136
I&#39;m gonna then add ANC 1 visits again

686
00:33:40,996 --> 00:33:43,286
and two closes.

687
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:46,206
Right, so now it&#39;s actually translating properly,

688
00:33:46,206 --> 00:33:48,356
so we are taking the average

689
00:33:48,356 --> 00:33:50,806
plus three standard deviations from the average.

690
00:33:50,806 --> 00:33:52,756
Remember, yesterday we talked about standard deviations

691
00:33:52,756 --> 00:33:54,156
and the bell curve.

692
00:33:54,156 --> 00:33:57,513
Three standard deviations off the average

693
00:33:57,513 --> 00:34:00,846
means that it&#39;s going to pick up any value

694
00:34:00,846 --> 00:34:03,316
that is 98% different

695
00:34:03,316 --> 00:34:05,926
than the average, okay?

696
00:34:05,926 --> 00:34:07,656
98% different than the average

697
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:10,069
over all of the sampled values.

698
00:34:12,726 --> 00:34:17,116
All right. Again, I have to give it a name.

699
00:34:17,116 --> 00:34:18,016
For the sake of time,

700
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:21,046
I&#39;m just gonna copy and paste that in there.

701
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:21,879
Submit.

702
00:34:32,516 --> 00:34:33,856
Okay, here it is again.

703
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,106
I&#39;m back into my PowerPoint,

704
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,516
so the formula for standard deviations

705
00:34:37,516 --> 00:34:40,356
is average plus the data element

706
00:34:41,315 --> 00:34:45,636
plus three standard deviations, three times S-T-D-D-E-V,

707
00:34:45,636 --> 00:34:47,089
and then ANC 1 again.

708
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:50,609
You might be wondering if this is case sensitive.

709
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:55,406
In older versions of DHIS2, it is case sensitive.

710
00:34:55,406 --> 00:34:56,946
In newer versions, it is not,

711
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:59,546
so if you&#39;re using DHIS2 point,

712
00:34:59,546 --> 00:35:03,056
I believe, 31 or older

713
00:35:03,056 --> 00:35:04,216
and you&#39;re using predictors,

714
00:35:04,216 --> 00:35:06,296
you need to put these in all capital letters.

715
00:35:06,296 --> 00:35:11,256
If you&#39;re using 31 or newer, so 31, 32, 33, or 34,

716
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:15,739
you can put these in lowercase letters, like you see here.

717
00:35:19,476 --> 00:35:22,056
Yeah, so here are the other functions for predictors.

718
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:23,216
You can see that there&#39;s quite a lot,

719
00:35:23,216 --> 00:35:24,896
like average, count, max, median,

720
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:26,709
min, standard deviation, sum.

721
00:35:27,766 --> 00:35:29,969
These can be used in different situations.

722
00:35:31,476 --> 00:35:35,776
The next step is that we have to define our counts.

723
00:35:35,776 --> 00:35:38,316
Sorry for the spelling mistake here on count,

724
00:35:38,316 --> 00:35:40,626
but we have to define our counts.

725
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,866
Now, again, in this particular situation,

726
00:35:42,866 --> 00:35:45,746
looking at producing an outlier threshold,

727
00:35:45,746 --> 00:35:49,316
we want to reference the last 12 months of data,

728
00:35:49,316 --> 00:35:51,586
so we are gonna say

729
00:35:51,586 --> 00:35:54,616
12 sequential sample counts here.

730
00:35:54,616 --> 00:35:56,746
A sequential sample count is just

731
00:35:56,746 --> 00:35:58,476
what was the last period?

732
00:35:58,476 --> 00:36:00,816
And how many of those periods do you wanna count?

733
00:36:00,816 --> 00:36:02,906
So we&#39;re gonna say our last period was months.

734
00:36:02,906 --> 00:36:05,216
We&#39;ve already defined that elsewhere in the predictor.

735
00:36:05,216 --> 00:36:06,316
We&#39;re gonna say 12.

736
00:36:06,316 --> 00:36:08,616
We wanna look at the last 12 months of data.

737
00:36:08,616 --> 00:36:10,376
Our annual sample count, which is saying

738
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,476
how many previous years do you wanna reference?

739
00:36:12,476 --> 00:36:14,996
We&#39;re gonna leave that one to zero,

740
00:36:14,996 --> 00:36:18,776
and then, we have a sequential skip count.

741
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:22,036
Sequential skip count will allow you to say

742
00:36:22,036 --> 00:36:25,669
I wanna skip some number of previous samples.

743
00:36:26,746 --> 00:36:28,876
In this case, we&#39;re not adding a,

744
00:36:28,876 --> 00:36:30,616
we don&#39;t need a sequential skip count,

745
00:36:30,616 --> 00:36:32,669
so we&#39;re not gonna even add it in,

746
00:36:34,756 --> 00:36:36,376
so what does this actually look like?

747
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:39,286
Let&#39;s pretend that we are in

748
00:36:40,486 --> 00:36:42,806
March right now, okay?

749
00:36:42,806 --> 00:36:44,556
Let&#39;s pretend that we are in March,

750
00:36:46,193 --> 00:36:48,386
and the numbers that you see listed here,

751
00:36:48,386 --> 00:36:49,866
these are months of the year,

752
00:36:49,866 --> 00:36:51,276
so January through December,

753
00:36:51,276 --> 00:36:55,019
and then 1, 2, 3, 4, January, February, March, April.

754
00:36:55,926 --> 00:36:58,276
Okay, so let&#39;s say that we are in April,

755
00:36:58,276 --> 00:37:01,576
and we say we have a sequential sample count of 12.

756
00:37:01,576 --> 00:37:02,936
What will that do?

757
00:37:02,936 --> 00:37:05,136
Well, that will take the previous 12 months,

758
00:37:05,136 --> 00:37:09,679
so that would take from March to April of last year,

759
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:12,366
annual sample count is zero,

760
00:37:12,366 --> 00:37:14,926
so we&#39;re just looking at just those last 12 months,

761
00:37:14,926 --> 00:37:16,056
and our skip count is zero,

762
00:37:16,056 --> 00:37:18,849
so we&#39;re not skipping any values in the last 12 months.

763
00:37:22,306 --> 00:37:25,966
This can become more complex, of course, right?

764
00:37:25,966 --> 00:37:27,776
So for seasonal data,

765
00:37:27,776 --> 00:37:30,466
you typically have to have some combination

766
00:37:30,466 --> 00:37:34,586
of annual sample count and sequential sample count

767
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:39,156
to be able to factor in the epi curve of malaria,

768
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:41,836
that bell curve that you have of seasonal malaria

769
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:43,589
or any kind of seasonal disease.

770
00:37:44,656 --> 00:37:47,206
I won&#39;t go into it now for the sake of time,

771
00:37:47,206 --> 00:37:48,926
but there is clear documentation

772
00:37:50,127 --> 00:37:52,826
on our website in our user manual

773
00:37:52,826 --> 00:37:54,326
on how to build out predictors

774
00:37:54,326 --> 00:37:56,816
using combinations of sequential sample counts

775
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:58,456
and annual sample counts

776
00:38:00,016 --> 00:38:02,269
to factor in more seasonal data.

777
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:14,726
So that is how you make

778
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:19,476
the outlier, or sorry, the predictor

779
00:38:19,476 --> 00:38:21,316
that generates the outlier threshold.

780
00:38:21,316 --> 00:38:24,146
How do we then put that into our validation rules?

781
00:38:24,146 --> 00:38:25,916
Again, we wanna have a validation rule

782
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:28,576
that checks the ANC 1 value

783
00:38:28,576 --> 00:38:30,916
against the ANC outlier threshold,

784
00:38:30,916 --> 00:38:32,726
and say if that ANC 1 value

785
00:38:32,726 --> 00:38:34,776
is higher than that outlier threshold,

786
00:38:34,776 --> 00:38:35,609
send me an alert.

787
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:36,456
Send me a notification.

788
00:38:36,456 --> 00:38:37,595
Let me know that this value

789
00:38:37,595 --> 00:38:42,039
is 99% different than the average.

790
00:38:43,676 --> 00:38:46,366
Well, it&#39;s the exact same process that we just went through

791
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,869
in building validation rules.

792
00:38:49,316 --> 00:38:53,292
Here, you can see building out the validation rule.

793
00:38:53,292 --> 00:38:54,406
We give it a name.

794
00:38:54,406 --> 00:38:56,096
We then give it a description.

795
00:38:56,096 --> 00:38:57,676
Again, an instruction.

796
00:38:57,676 --> 00:38:59,786
You can define the importance.

797
00:38:59,786 --> 00:39:01,056
Our monthly type, again,

798
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:03,966
or sorry, excuse me, our period type, again, is monthly.

799
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:07,286
Our left-side expression is ANC 1 visits.

800
00:39:07,286 --> 00:39:09,966
Our operator is less than,

801
00:39:09,966 --> 00:39:12,946
and our right-side operator or expression

802
00:39:12,946 --> 00:39:15,416
will be ANC 1 threshold,

803
00:39:15,416 --> 00:39:17,946
so again, validation rules need to be defined

804
00:39:17,946 --> 00:39:19,756
based on what we know to be true,

805
00:39:19,756 --> 00:39:23,466
and in this case, we can interpret that to be ANC 1 visits

806
00:39:23,466 --> 00:39:28,466
should be less than ANC 1 outlier threshold,

807
00:39:28,536 --> 00:39:31,836
and again, that threshold value is a data element

808
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,139
that is coming from a predictor,

809
00:39:37,226 --> 00:39:39,709
so what happens when we run this validation rule?

810
00:39:41,256 --> 00:39:43,876
We can see that we received

811
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:46,569
a lot of validation notifications,

812
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:51,426
and just looking at this one example here,

813
00:39:51,426 --> 00:39:56,006
we can see

814
00:39:56,006 --> 00:39:58,866
that we have a value

815
00:39:58,866 --> 00:40:03,256
for facility 583 in October 2019

816
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:04,446
that was reported

817
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:08,976
a ANC 1 value of 126,

818
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:13,826
but our outlier threshold is 117.9,

819
00:40:13,826 --> 00:40:14,773
so it&#39;s saying, &quot;Hey, look.

820
00:40:14,773 --> 00:40:17,643
&quot;126 is bigger than 117.9.

821
00:40:17,643 --> 00:40:19,173
&quot;It should be less than.

822
00:40:19,173 --> 00:40:21,439
&quot;Here&#39;s an alert,&quot; okay?

823
00:40:24,646 --> 00:40:27,216
Before I cut over to

824
00:40:28,936 --> 00:40:31,206
revisiting some of the scheduling,

825
00:40:31,206 --> 00:40:33,066
I do wanna quickly show you

826
00:40:33,066 --> 00:40:36,819
how you use predictors to count org units,

827
00:40:38,321 --> 00:40:39,406
and in this case,

828
00:40:39,406 --> 00:40:42,516
I&#39;m saying I&#39;m counting the number of org units

829
00:40:42,516 --> 00:40:45,526
that have a stock-out of some commodity.

830
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,006
This is not related to data quality.

831
00:40:47,006 --> 00:40:50,079
It&#39;s just highly requested thing to know,

832
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:53,026
and so, in predictors,

833
00:40:53,026 --> 00:40:56,796
we can also put in if statements in our generators,

834
00:40:56,796 --> 00:40:59,386
and that if statement here,

835
00:40:59,386 --> 00:41:01,046
if you look at the translator,

836
00:41:01,046 --> 00:41:05,056
where it says valid at the bottom of the screenshot,

837
00:41:05,056 --> 00:41:07,156
just directly above that, you have the translation,

838
00:41:07,156 --> 00:41:10,229
and this saying if the stock-out of RDTs,

839
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:15,816
number of days is greater than zero,

840
00:41:15,816 --> 00:41:17,526
count a one.

841
00:41:17,526 --> 00:41:20,356
If not, record a zero,

842
00:41:20,356 --> 00:41:22,196
so what is that actually gonna do?

843
00:41:22,196 --> 00:41:25,526
That&#39;s gonna say that if you have more than one,

844
00:41:25,526 --> 00:41:28,546
or if you have one or more days of stock-out of RDTs

845
00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:31,046
that&#39;s recorded in your monthly reporting form,

846
00:41:31,046 --> 00:41:33,429
then it&#39;s going to count a one value,

847
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:38,646
and that one will be saved as a data element

848
00:41:38,646 --> 00:41:40,796
against that facility,

849
00:41:40,796 --> 00:41:42,576
and you can use that value

850
00:41:42,576 --> 00:41:44,206
to then aggregate up the hierarchy

851
00:41:44,206 --> 00:41:45,486
and say how many facilities

852
00:41:45,486 --> 00:41:48,386
did I have a stock-out of RDTs last month?

853
00:41:48,386 --> 00:41:51,516
Or you can even, say, put that value onto a map,

854
00:41:51,516 --> 00:41:53,456
and you can make a map showing specifically

855
00:41:53,456 --> 00:41:56,829
these are the facilities that had a stock-out last month.

856
00:41:57,736 --> 00:42:00,236
That&#39;s how predictors can be used

857
00:42:00,236 --> 00:42:01,516
to count health facilities.

858
00:42:01,516 --> 00:42:04,486
Again, it&#39;s a little bit more of an advanced concept.

859
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:06,756
If you have questions, please send those on Slack,

860
00:42:06,756 --> 00:42:09,546
and we&#39;ll be happy to come back to them.

861
00:42:09,546 --> 00:42:10,556
For the sake of time here,

862
00:42:10,556 --> 00:42:12,756
we don&#39;t have time to go into

863
00:42:12,756 --> 00:42:16,256
more advanced functionalities with predictors,

864
00:42:16,256 --> 00:42:18,036
but there is a lot that you can do with them.

865
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,586
Hopefully, you appreciate that.

866
00:42:21,136 --> 00:42:25,356
All right, so one additional point

867
00:42:25,356 --> 00:42:26,376
that I need to make

868
00:42:29,606 --> 00:42:31,446
is that predictors

869
00:42:32,746 --> 00:42:37,746
also have to be scheduled in the Scheduler app, okay?

870
00:42:37,886 --> 00:42:40,686
So it&#39;s a different job

871
00:42:41,644 --> 00:42:42,486
than the maintenance job

872
00:42:42,486 --> 00:42:46,636
that we use to schedule validation rules,

873
00:42:46,636 --> 00:42:49,669
so we have our ANC outlier threshold,

874
00:42:50,556 --> 00:42:53,156
and we are going to make the job type predictor.

875
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:57,489
Again, you select the frequency that you want.

876
00:42:58,956 --> 00:43:01,036
Just like we did the validation rules, exact same,

877
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,846
you can select a predefined frequency.

878
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:05,956
You can put in your own frequency through a cron expression,

879
00:43:05,956 --> 00:43:07,816
or you could say continuous execution.

880
00:43:07,816 --> 00:43:09,336
Again, I highly recommend

881
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:11,996
that you do not use continuous execution

882
00:43:11,996 --> 00:43:16,026
unless you are in a disease-surveillance scenario,

883
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:18,826
and you&#39;re only using one or maybe two validation rules.

884
00:43:19,946 --> 00:43:22,006
The job type will be predictor.

885
00:43:22,006 --> 00:43:23,266
This is, again, different.

886
00:43:23,266 --> 00:43:27,796
The job type for the validation rule

887
00:43:27,796 --> 00:43:30,416
was a monitoring job type.

888
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:32,176
This is a predictor job type,

889
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,906
but the parameters are the same,

890
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:36,306
so we have to define our relative start

891
00:43:36,306 --> 00:43:37,739
and our relative end.

892
00:43:38,956 --> 00:43:41,876
Again, rule of thumb, relative start, negative 60,

893
00:43:41,876 --> 00:43:42,976
maybe negative 30.

894
00:43:42,976 --> 00:43:46,746
You just wanna cover a few previous months, right?

895
00:43:46,746 --> 00:43:50,216
Relative in to being just one, which is tomorrow,

896
00:43:50,216 --> 00:43:52,436
and then, when we have to give our predictors

897
00:43:52,436 --> 00:43:54,016
into our Scheduler,

898
00:43:54,016 --> 00:43:56,286
so you just type out the predictors here.

899
00:43:56,286 --> 00:44:00,396
You&#39;ll be able to select them, and then you add the job.

900
00:44:00,396 --> 00:44:05,246
Now, let&#39;s say that you have some predictor jobs.

901
00:44:05,246 --> 00:44:07,363
Then, you have your analytics tables

902
00:44:07,363 --> 00:44:09,529
and your validation rule alerts.

903
00:44:10,976 --> 00:44:12,276
If you&#39;re a system administrator,

904
00:44:12,276 --> 00:44:13,546
I&#39;m talking to you right now.

905
00:44:13,546 --> 00:44:15,356
If you&#39;re not a DHIS2 techie,

906
00:44:15,356 --> 00:44:17,806
you&#39;re probably not gonna appreciate a lot of this,

907
00:44:17,806 --> 00:44:19,046
but the point to be made

908
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:24,026
is that you have to schedule these jobs to run concurrently.

909
00:44:24,026 --> 00:44:28,156
You cannot schedule these jobs to run at the same time,

910
00:44:28,156 --> 00:44:31,356
and they need to run in a specific order, okay?

911
00:44:31,356 --> 00:44:33,206
For you to actually be able to generate

912
00:44:33,206 --> 00:44:35,516
your validation rule alerts,

913
00:44:35,516 --> 00:44:36,586
so the first thing is that

914
00:44:36,586 --> 00:44:40,936
you schedule the predictors jobs to run first, okay?

915
00:44:40,936 --> 00:44:43,646
And you, again, you want to have all of these jobs run

916
00:44:43,646 --> 00:44:45,386
when the server usage is low,

917
00:44:45,386 --> 00:44:48,136
when there&#39;s not a lot of people on the database.

918
00:44:48,136 --> 00:44:50,056
The predictor jobs, for example,

919
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:52,106
you see the example here on the right side of the screen,

920
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:55,966
could run at, say, 11 o&#39;clock, 23 on a Sunday.

921
00:44:55,966 --> 00:44:58,736
Very few people are gonna be looking at DHIS2

922
00:44:58,736 --> 00:45:00,239
at 11 o&#39;clock on a Sunday.

923
00:45:01,486 --> 00:45:04,836
Then you have your analytics tables run after that.

924
00:45:04,836 --> 00:45:06,456
Again, the analytics tables

925
00:45:06,456 --> 00:45:09,886
are just a function that has to be performed

926
00:45:09,886 --> 00:45:11,946
in order to see the data on the dashboards

927
00:45:11,946 --> 00:45:15,686
or in the Data Visualizer on maps, et cetera,

928
00:45:15,686 --> 00:45:17,156
so you want those to probably run

929
00:45:17,156 --> 00:45:19,316
right after their predictors.

930
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,296
You can have that run maybe an hour later.

931
00:45:21,296 --> 00:45:23,239
Run that at midnight on Sunday.

932
00:45:24,336 --> 00:45:26,416
Analytics tables, depending on the size of your database,

933
00:45:26,416 --> 00:45:28,336
may take a while,

934
00:45:28,336 --> 00:45:33,026
so if you give yourself a few extra hours of buffer,

935
00:45:33,026 --> 00:45:36,066
and say then you want your validation rule alerts jobs

936
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,056
to run at maybe 03,

937
00:45:39,056 --> 00:45:43,976
so a few hours after your tables, your analytics tables,

938
00:45:43,976 --> 00:45:45,886
and if you run them in this order,

939
00:45:45,886 --> 00:45:47,956
that means that your predictors come first.

940
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:52,056
Those predictors are then able to be seen on your dashboards

941
00:45:52,056 --> 00:45:54,566
if you want, if you have them there,

942
00:45:54,566 --> 00:45:56,666
and then, they&#39;ll be able to be pushed out

943
00:45:59,436 --> 00:46:00,766
in your e-mails.

944
00:46:00,766 --> 00:46:02,776
If everything goes properly,

945
00:46:02,776 --> 00:46:05,936
then this will all happen when you&#39;re asleep.

946
00:46:05,936 --> 00:46:07,286
When you wake up in the morning,

947
00:46:07,286 --> 00:46:09,076
you&#39;ll see an e-mail from DHIS2

948
00:46:09,076 --> 00:46:10,233
saying, &quot;Hey, look.

949
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:14,133
&quot;These are the alerts that were generated last night.&quot;

950
00:46:18,466 --> 00:46:19,299
Okay.

951
00:46:22,246 --> 00:46:24,736
There is some question

952
00:46:24,736 --> 00:46:27,676
already posted in the community practice

953
00:46:27,676 --> 00:46:32,216
or on the Slack channel around how do I get e-mail?

954
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:35,856
Or how do I configure DHIS2 to send an e-mail?

955
00:46:35,856 --> 00:46:37,546
Well, the reality is that

956
00:46:37,546 --> 00:46:40,796
you have to generate an e-mail service

957
00:46:40,796 --> 00:46:42,839
from your service provider.

958
00:46:44,056 --> 00:46:49,056
DHIS2 does not have a built-in e-mail host.

959
00:46:49,266 --> 00:46:50,986
This has to be provided from your service provider,

960
00:46:50,986 --> 00:46:53,986
so if you are a ministry of health,

961
00:46:53,986 --> 00:46:57,056
and you are using a telecommunications company

962
00:46:57,056 --> 00:47:01,056
in your country hosting your DHIS2 instance,

963
00:47:01,056 --> 00:47:04,696
or hosting, say, your e-mail service for your ministry,

964
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:08,046
that host, that company, whoever it is,

965
00:47:08,046 --> 00:47:12,696
needs to provide an e-mail host

966
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:15,946
or an e-mail endpoint for your DHIS2 instance

967
00:47:15,946 --> 00:47:17,436
to be able to send e-mails.

968
00:47:17,436 --> 00:47:18,296
Again, not something

969
00:47:18,296 --> 00:47:20,286
that University of Oslo can provide you,

970
00:47:20,286 --> 00:47:21,119
so it has to come

971
00:47:21,119 --> 00:47:23,569
from whoever&#39;s hosting your e-mail service.

972
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:27,546
Many of you are probably using Google

973
00:47:29,068 --> 00:47:30,896
as your default e-mail service,

974
00:47:30,896 --> 00:47:32,869
so if you have a Gmail, for example,

975
00:47:33,926 --> 00:47:36,706
and if you are using Google,

976
00:47:36,706 --> 00:47:38,466
then we&#39;ve given you some of the guidance

977
00:47:38,466 --> 00:47:40,109
on how to configure this,

978
00:47:41,836 --> 00:47:43,696
but you have to provide a host name,

979
00:47:43,696 --> 00:47:46,966
a port number, a username, a password.

980
00:47:46,966 --> 00:47:49,416
A username and password, this is for your e-mail service.

981
00:47:49,416 --> 00:47:51,726
This is not for your DHIS2.

982
00:47:51,726 --> 00:47:56,576
You need to provide a TLS, an e-mail sender address,

983
00:47:56,576 --> 00:48:00,269
and an address to send test e-mails.

984
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:03,606
Again, all of this has to be provided

985
00:48:03,606 --> 00:48:05,469
by your e-mail service provider.

986
00:48:06,646 --> 00:48:08,226
We cannot provide this to you.

987
00:48:08,226 --> 00:48:11,876
This has to come from whoever&#39;s hosting your e-mail service.

988
00:48:11,876 --> 00:48:15,286
Any telecommunications company that hosts e-mail services

989
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:17,483
should be able to provide this to you.

990
00:48:19,336 --> 00:48:22,106
These are fairly basic things, to be honest with you.

991
00:48:22,106 --> 00:48:23,966
The example that you see here is

992
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:27,989
if you have your e-mail hosted by, say, Amazon Web Services,

993
00:48:29,076 --> 00:48:30,246
on the left side of the screen,

994
00:48:30,246 --> 00:48:33,686
and like we do here at DHIS2,

995
00:48:33,686 --> 00:48:35,456
we have our e-mail&#39;s hosted by Amazon Web Services,

996
00:48:35,456 --> 00:48:38,306
so that would be our host criteria.

997
00:48:38,306 --> 00:48:39,756
Of course, you don&#39;t have our password,

998
00:48:39,756 --> 00:48:42,189
so you can&#39;t use the same thing.

999
00:48:42,613 --> 00:48:45,613
Okay, so we have maybe just 10 more minutes

1000
00:48:45,613 --> 00:48:47,183
for any burning questions.

1001
00:48:47,183 --> 00:48:50,813
Nora, is there any terrible issues out there,

1002
00:48:50,813 --> 00:48:53,326
or what&#39;s the most terrible issue out there?

1003
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:58,033
- [Nora] Yes, Scott, there were a few questions.

1004
00:48:59,343 --> 00:49:03,813
I&#39;m just going through them.

1005
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:07,930
Under introduce yourself from (indistinct).

1006
00:49:08,966 --> 00:49:12,583
Does predictors work in event and tracker too?

1007
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:15,246
How does that different from program indicators?

1008
00:49:16,903 --> 00:49:18,153
- [Scott] That&#39;s a really good question.

1009
00:49:18,153 --> 00:49:22,073
Yes, you can use event and tracker data in predictors.

1010
00:49:22,073 --> 00:49:26,793
The difference between a program indicator

1011
00:49:26,793 --> 00:49:29,753
is that that predictor value is actually saved

1012
00:49:29,753 --> 00:49:31,933
as a data element, right?

1013
00:49:31,933 --> 00:49:36,513
So you&#39;re able to, then, use that predicted value

1014
00:49:36,513 --> 00:49:40,403
in other calculations, in validation rule notifications,

1015
00:49:40,403 --> 00:49:42,723
anywhere that you can use a data element,

1016
00:49:42,723 --> 00:49:44,063
and that&#39;s very unique

1017
00:49:44,063 --> 00:49:47,703
in that you cannot do that with a program indicator.

1018
00:49:47,703 --> 00:49:49,873
There&#39;s also different types of calculations

1019
00:49:49,873 --> 00:49:51,763
that can be done in predictors

1020
00:49:51,763 --> 00:49:56,616
that cannot be done in program indicators.

1021
00:49:57,893 --> 00:50:00,993
Predictors can also incorporate values

1022
00:50:00,993 --> 00:50:03,603
across multiple programs,

1023
00:50:03,603 --> 00:50:05,183
so that could be very useful to you,

1024
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,693
that if you have a program for ANC,

1025
00:50:07,693 --> 00:50:10,243
a program for immunization, a program for birth,

1026
00:50:10,243 --> 00:50:13,753
or follow-up, or something like that,

1027
00:50:13,753 --> 00:50:15,013
and you want to have a value

1028
00:50:15,013 --> 00:50:17,433
across all of those different programs,

1029
00:50:17,433 --> 00:50:20,693
you can use that to make a single calculation.

1030
00:50:20,693 --> 00:50:22,183
You can do that in a predictor.

1031
00:50:22,183 --> 00:50:24,516
You cannot do that in a program indicator.

1032
00:50:29,073 --> 00:50:30,533
Any other questions?

1033
00:50:30,533 --> 00:50:33,726
- [Nora] Yes, there was something about

1034
00:50:33,726 --> 00:50:37,856
can you use data elements across different data sets?

1035
00:50:39,863 --> 00:50:40,833
- [Scott] Yes, yeah, of course,

1036
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:44,073
you can use any combination of data elements that you want

1037
00:50:44,073 --> 00:50:45,073
to make a predictor.

1038
00:50:47,273 --> 00:50:49,486
- [Nora] And then, for the general QA,

1039
00:50:51,163 --> 00:50:53,873
that the number of, from Fernando,

1040
00:50:53,873 --> 00:50:56,413
the number of standard deviation to add to the average

1041
00:50:56,413 --> 00:50:57,840
to set the thresholds that vary

1042
00:50:57,840 --> 00:51:00,173
depending on the value we&#39;re tracking,

1043
00:51:00,173 --> 00:51:02,473
but a good rule of thumb is three,

1044
00:51:02,473 --> 00:51:06,643
and I think that is what you are (indistinct) using.

1045
00:51:06,643 --> 00:51:08,863
- [Scott] Yeah, I think he said it perfectly.

1046
00:51:08,863 --> 00:51:09,983
I would totally agree.

1047
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:12,253
I think three is a good rule of thumb.

1048
00:51:12,253 --> 00:51:15,423
We don&#39;t have the intelligence in DHIS2 yet

1049
00:51:15,423 --> 00:51:18,253
to be a little bit more flexible there.

1050
00:51:18,253 --> 00:51:22,423
We would like it to help the user define

1051
00:51:22,423 --> 00:51:25,686
what would be an appropriate number of standard deviations.

1052
00:51:26,823 --> 00:51:29,443
We are kind of starting to explore how to do that,

1053
00:51:29,443 --> 00:51:31,113
but right now, I think you&#39;re absolutely right.

1054
00:51:31,113 --> 00:51:32,713
Just set it to three.

1055
00:51:32,713 --> 00:51:34,493
Three is probably not going to steer you wrong

1056
00:51:34,493 --> 00:51:35,556
in most cases.

1057
00:51:37,063 --> 00:51:39,223
- [Nora] Then there&#39;s a question just above that

1058
00:51:39,223 --> 00:51:41,153
from Paul from Cameroon.

1059
00:51:41,153 --> 00:51:44,423
Can you explain the significance of each term:

1060
00:51:44,423 --> 00:51:49,086
0, 1 0 0, 1, 0?

1061
00:51:49,923 --> 00:51:51,883
I think that&#39;s a cron expression?

1062
00:51:53,393 --> 00:51:55,023
- [Scott] That could be a cron expression.

1063
00:51:55,023 --> 00:51:59,396
It could also be that he was referring to the if statement,

1064
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,153
so I could go a little bit more into detail

1065
00:52:04,153 --> 00:52:05,263
on the cron expression,

1066
00:52:05,263 --> 00:52:09,563
so let me just get back.

1067
00:52:09,563 --> 00:52:11,113
Let me go to the Scheduler app.

1068
00:52:16,863 --> 00:52:18,773
Okay, so it looks like some folks have already done this.

1069
00:52:18,773 --> 00:52:22,373
That&#39;s great, so the cron expression...

1070
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:29,803
If I just make a new job, I&#39;ve gotta define my job type.

1071
00:52:29,803 --> 00:52:32,453
Again, the monitoring job is for validation rules.

1072
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:34,573
The predictor is for predictors,

1073
00:52:34,573 --> 00:52:37,443
so I&#39;m just gonna make a validation rules.

1074
00:52:37,443 --> 00:52:39,086
My cron expression,

1075
00:52:40,123 --> 00:52:42,733
I have the ones that I can already choose,

1076
00:52:42,733 --> 00:52:44,876
so like every day at midnight,

1077
00:52:52,510 --> 00:52:54,490
and, say, every week,

1078
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,593
and this would be every week

1079
00:52:58,813 --> 00:53:01,593
at 3, I think it&#39;s 3:00 a.m.,

1080
00:53:01,593 --> 00:53:05,846
so I&#39;m just gonna say test, Add Job.

1081
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:10,773
Yeah, okay, so that would be the first day at every day,

1082
00:53:10,773 --> 00:53:12,323
first day of the week at 3:00 a.m.,

1083
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:13,843
so let me kind of explain this to you

1084
00:53:13,843 --> 00:53:15,043
a little bit more clearly,

1085
00:53:15,043 --> 00:53:17,153
so each one of these values,

1086
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:18,023
so we have

1087
00:53:18,023 --> 00:53:21,256
0 0 3 ? *

1088
00:53:22,443 --> 00:53:23,873
and then MON.

1089
00:53:23,873 --> 00:53:25,283
Well, hopefully, you understand the MON.

1090
00:53:25,283 --> 00:53:26,116
That&#39;s Monday,

1091
00:53:27,493 --> 00:53:31,563
so each one of these actually represents a unit of time,

1092
00:53:31,563 --> 00:53:34,863
so we have second, minute,

1093
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:37,283
so zero, zero seconds,

1094
00:53:37,283 --> 00:53:41,023
at zero minutes on the third hour,

1095
00:53:41,023 --> 00:53:45,283
and then we have day and month,

1096
00:53:45,283 --> 00:53:50,283
so it&#39;s the day is defined as Monday, and the month is,

1097
00:53:50,503 --> 00:53:53,543
or sorry, we have a day and week,

1098
00:53:53,543 --> 00:53:55,343
and then the day of the week, month,

1099
00:53:56,753 --> 00:53:59,543
so we have this running every Monday.

1100
00:53:59,543 --> 00:54:02,793
Now, I know that is kind of confusing to folks.

1101
00:54:02,793 --> 00:54:04,653
Please just Google it, so

1102
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:11,623
if I just Google cron expressions,

1103
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:15,093
there are free formatters online

1104
00:54:15,093 --> 00:54:17,763
for building cron expressions,

1105
00:54:17,763 --> 00:54:19,246
so, for example,

1106
00:54:22,643 --> 00:54:25,623
if I want to say I want something to run

1107
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:33,523
every month, then...

1108
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:36,763
I&#39;m sorry.

1109
00:54:36,763 --> 00:54:40,433
I want something to run every day

1110
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:42,593
starting on Sunday.

1111
00:54:42,593 --> 00:54:46,143
Then automatically generates a cron expression for me.

1112
00:54:46,143 --> 00:54:49,043
If I could say I want every day

1113
00:54:49,043 --> 00:54:51,383
on the first day of the month,

1114
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:52,443
then you see it generates a cron expression,

1115
00:54:52,443 --> 00:54:54,056
so if I copy this,

1116
00:54:56,723 --> 00:54:57,926
go back to DHIS2.

1117
00:55:02,270 --> 00:55:03,103
- [Man] All right, Scott,

1118
00:55:03,103 --> 00:55:05,433
there was an update about that question from the user.

1119
00:55:05,433 --> 00:55:09,561
Apparently, it&#39;s about predictor configuration.

1120
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:13,373
(Nora speaks indistinctly)

1121
00:55:13,373 --> 00:55:16,276
- [Scott] Okay, well, let me just finish this then,

1122
00:55:17,203 --> 00:55:19,233
so I&#39;ve just copy-and-pasted the cron expression

1123
00:55:19,233 --> 00:55:22,586
for every day, the first day of every month here,

1124
00:55:23,613 --> 00:55:25,073
so you see that.

1125
00:55:25,073 --> 00:55:27,146
If I click Save Changes,

1126
00:55:27,983 --> 00:55:30,703
then you see you can say when&#39;s my next execution?

1127
00:55:30,703 --> 00:55:31,943
You can see my next execution

1128
00:55:31,943 --> 00:55:35,695
is November 1st at midnight, okay?

1129
00:55:35,695 --> 00:55:36,543
So you see that there,

1130
00:55:36,543 --> 00:55:38,643
so that&#39;s how you can do cron expressions.

1131
00:55:40,633 --> 00:55:42,153
The actual question was

1132
00:55:42,153 --> 00:55:46,083
on setting the org unit level for the predictors.

1133
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:46,916
Is that correct?

1134
00:55:48,363 --> 00:55:51,183
- [Nora] It was to do, to count facilities

1135
00:55:53,622 --> 00:55:55,166
with dropout drugs.

1136
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:58,203
- [Scott] Yeah, so this is not...

1137
00:55:58,203 --> 00:56:00,533
Actually, in two weeks, we have an entire academy

1138
00:56:00,533 --> 00:56:01,783
on supply chain

1139
00:56:01,783 --> 00:56:04,133
and building predictors for the supply chain,

1140
00:56:04,133 --> 00:56:06,643
so I recommend that you attend that academy

1141
00:56:06,643 --> 00:56:09,183
if you really wanna specifically know how to do that,

1142
00:56:09,183 --> 00:56:11,933
but very quickly here, let me just show you,

1143
00:56:11,933 --> 00:56:14,063
if I wanna count the number of facilities

1144
00:56:14,063 --> 00:56:18,113
that have any specific value that&#39;s recorded,

1145
00:56:18,113 --> 00:56:23,093
I go into my generator, and I type if, open brackets,

1146
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:25,163
and I&#39;m just gonna say

1147
00:56:25,163 --> 00:56:27,833
acute flaccid paralysis death under five,

1148
00:56:27,833 --> 00:56:29,313
just for the exam,

1149
00:56:29,313 --> 00:56:32,843
and I&#39;m gonna say if acute flaccid paralysis deaths

1150
00:56:32,843 --> 00:56:37,563
are greater than, let&#39;s say five,

1151
00:56:37,563 --> 00:56:39,113
then record one,

1152
00:56:39,113 --> 00:56:41,733
if else, record a zero.

1153
00:56:41,733 --> 00:56:43,653
Now, what does this predictor do?

1154
00:56:43,653 --> 00:56:45,923
You can see that it is considered valid.

1155
00:56:45,923 --> 00:56:49,153
This will say if that health facility that month

1156
00:56:49,153 --> 00:56:53,523
recorded more than five acute flaccid paralysis deaths,

1157
00:56:53,523 --> 00:56:56,173
then it will count one,

1158
00:56:56,173 --> 00:56:58,823
so the way you translate these if statements is like

1159
00:56:58,823 --> 00:57:01,873
if this, then this;

1160
00:57:01,873 --> 00:57:04,053
if else, then this,

1161
00:57:04,053 --> 00:57:09,033
so if this is greater than five, count one;

1162
00:57:09,033 --> 00:57:13,273
if else, count zero, all right?

1163
00:57:13,273 --> 00:57:17,033
So this is basic, basic, basic,

1164
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:20,993
basic computer programming, basic if statements,

1165
00:57:20,993 --> 00:57:22,663
but here, that&#39;s what is going on,

1166
00:57:22,663 --> 00:57:26,733
so if this is greater than five,

1167
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:27,913
then count one;

1168
00:57:27,913 --> 00:57:29,123
if else, count zero,

1169
00:57:29,123 --> 00:57:30,243
and so what will this do?

1170
00:57:30,243 --> 00:57:33,630
This will say, &quot;Oh, this facility had more than five.

1171
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:34,983
&quot;Record a one value,&quot;

1172
00:57:34,983 --> 00:57:38,023
and that one value, again, is saved as a data element,

1173
00:57:38,023 --> 00:57:40,973
and that data element can be aggregated up,

1174
00:57:40,973 --> 00:57:44,553
so you can say how many, across the entire country,

1175
00:57:44,553 --> 00:57:47,773
how many health facilities did I have more than five

1176
00:57:47,773 --> 00:57:50,983
acute flaccid paralysis deaths this month?

1177
00:57:50,983 --> 00:57:51,983
And you&#39;ll have a number there

1178
00:57:51,983 --> 00:57:53,963
because for every single one that does,

1179
00:57:53,963 --> 00:57:57,213
it&#39;s counting a one, okay?

1180
00:57:57,213 --> 00:58:00,113
Now, this is a very basic example.

1181
00:58:00,113 --> 00:58:02,973
You can make these much, much more complex,

1182
00:58:02,973 --> 00:58:03,933
and you&#39;ll actually,

1183
00:58:03,933 --> 00:58:06,583
if you do come to the Supply Chain Academy in two weeks,

1184
00:58:06,583 --> 00:58:07,883
you&#39;ll see that we&#39;ve made some

1185
00:58:07,883 --> 00:58:09,923
that are much more complex than this,

1186
00:58:09,923 --> 00:58:11,283
but this is a very basic one

1187
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:13,323
to be able to count the number of facilities

1188
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:15,386
that record any particular value.
