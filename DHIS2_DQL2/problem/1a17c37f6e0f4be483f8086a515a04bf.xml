<p>Explanation</p>

<p>B and C are correct. A is insufficient. As data elements are often dimensionalized by categories/category combinations, Matching 1 program indicator with 1 data element will only work if the data element does not have any other dimensions than “default”. In other cases, both the data element and the category option combination have to be matched in order to enable correct data transfer.</p>
