<h3>Exercise 1 - Configuring the WHO Data Quality Tool - Indicators and Data Elements </h3>
<p class= "text">For this exercise, you will need to fill in the following table using the WHO metadata browser app. You will need to recreate the table to fill it in.</p>
<p><img src="/static/M6.2_Table_V1.1.JPG" alt="table"></p>
<p class= "text">The data elements you are looking for will be located in either the “Immunisation” or “ANC” data element groups. This exercise is meant to allow you to map some of the default numerators that are within the Data Quality tool to the names within a specific configuration.</p>
<p class= "text">As an example, the default name for the number of Measles 1 doses given in the data quality tool is MCV 1.</p>
<p><img src="/static/M6.2_Example1_v1.0.png" alt="table"></p>
<p class= "text">If you explore the data elements available within the metadata browser we will not see any data element named “MCV 1”; however, you will see a data element called “Measles 1 vaccine given.”

<p class= "text">This type of mapping is generally necessary between the default values of the data quality tool and the names either in the example system being used here, or your own system if the names are not the same as the default values within the DQ tool. The data element or indicator groups is also important, as the DQ tool has a limitation that does not allow it to map any metadata that is not part of a group.</p> 
<p class= "text">An example of the table for MCV 1 has been filled for your reference.</p>
<p><img src="/static/M6.2_Table_2_V1.1.JPG" alt="table 2"></p>
<p class= "text">Once you have completed the table, follow the instructions below:</p> 
<ol>
<li class= "text">Return to the Numerators page of the Tool (launch the Tool, then click on “More,” then click on “Administration”).</li>
  <li class= "text">For each of the first 3 numerators in your table from Exercise 1, click on “Edit,” complete the configuration and save.</li>
</ol>
