00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,560
- [Bob] I&#39;m going to share with you

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,410
something called the WHO&#39;s framework

3
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,800
for data quality review.

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,090
This is an approach to assessing

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:16,250
the quality of the data,

6
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,160
which are routinely reported

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,423
by health facilities each month.

8
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:24,610
There are a variety of tools

9
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:28,490
that you may be familiar with for assessing data quality.

10
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:30,750
Here are several of them.

11
00:00:33,866 --> 00:00:38,270
WHO has a data quality review tool kit

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:43,010
that you can access using this web link.

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,320
We will provide you with these PowerPoint slides

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,110
and later, perhaps, you can browse this website

15
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,430
and even download the three documents

16
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,930
that describe in greater detail

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,403
the WHO data quality review framework.

18
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,730
To begin with, we should say something

19
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,773
about the frequency of data quality review.

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:12,380
This assessment of the quality of data

21
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:15,470
could take place at various frequencies.

22
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,530
It could be monthly, and this is going to be a large

23
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,670
part of the focus of this workshop,

24
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,500
how staff at health facility

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,010
and district level could routinely,

26
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:30,493
that is monthly, assess data quality.

27
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:33,940
On the other hand, at a national level,

28
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,080
there should be a process that is at least once each year,

29
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,530
perhaps just before the annual health summit,

30
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,780
the annual review of progress

31
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,420
against the core indicators

32
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,160
to assure the quality of data

33
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,080
before they are interpreted for the annual review.

34
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,810
And then in the longer run

35
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,070
certain specific health programs,

36
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:03,380
such as the immunization program or the HIV/AIDS program,

37
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,330
might have every three to five years

38
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,803
of more in-depth program specific review.

39
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,210
There are two principle methods

40
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:19,900
for assessing the quality of routine data.

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,840
The first involves surveys,

42
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,160
or at least, a supervisory visit

43
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,310
it requires a visit to the health facility

44
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,450
to examine the facility registers,

45
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,620
recount the data and compare

46
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:35,640
that recounts of data with the data

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,110
that have been recorded

48
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:40,363
and reported on the monthly report.

49
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:44,000
This type of visit to the health facility

50
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,480
allows the surveyor or the supervisor

51
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,297
to as well collect information

52
00:02:50,297 --> 00:02:53,610
about such things as the availability of staff

53
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:57,580
or the presence of standard operating procedures,

54
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,210
or whether there are sufficient numbers

55
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,140
of reporting formats available,

56
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,290
and the supervisor or surveyor can examine

57
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,320
the health facility or the district health office

58
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,870
to see evidence of use of data,

59
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,743
visualization of data.

60
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,220
Now, with all of these advantages

61
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,230
of a data verification survey,

62
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:23,950
or a visit to the health facility,

63
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,590
it has to be acknowledged that it is expensive

64
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,790
it requires travel.

65
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:35,790
And for this reason such an approach is often infrequent.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,210
And sometimes it is applied

67
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:41,590
only to a sample of health facilities

68
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,470
or a sample of districts.

69
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,880
On the other hand, there&#39;s the other approach

70
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,140
which we referred to as the data desk review.

71
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,960
And that&#39;s going to be the main focus of this workshop.

72
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,780
No travel is required.

73
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,460
It&#39;s called a desk review

74
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:01,010
&#39;cause it can be done from the office

75
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,610
where the data base is maintained.

76
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,640
If someone has access to the DHIS2 instance,

77
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,010
then they can undertake a review,

78
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,130
not just occasionally,

79
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:15,910
but it can be done monthly.

80
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,250
It&#39;s practical to do this

81
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,820
and not just for a sample of health facilities,

82
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,507
but the review can look at the data

83
00:04:25,507 --> 00:04:29,530
for all health facilities nationwide.

84
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,530
And if the right tools are installed in the DHIS2,

85
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,680
then this desk review is able to actually drill down

86
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,940
and that is investigate at a lower level

87
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,710
and find out were there any suspicious data

88
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,043
have been reporting from.

89
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:51,626
