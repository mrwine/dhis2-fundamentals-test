00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:02,780
- [Instructor] So we&#39;ve talked a bit about form design

1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,110
and I kind of went through that rather quickly.

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:07,360
It&#39;s just kind of a background piece of information

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,090
that I&#39;d like you to consider

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,570
when you&#39;re looking at your data.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,650
You can see actually it&#39;s not just form design,

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,230
but when you review your outputs,

7
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,310
you might also see a lot of this happening

8
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:18,750
either between programs or within programs

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,140
where they&#39;re collecting duplicate data

10
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,410
or where there&#39;s incorrect desegregations.

11
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,470
And that is something to identify

12
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,820
and work with programs to try and update as you go forward,

13
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,290
because collecting all this duplicate information

14
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:32,543
can result in really poor data quality.

15
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,400
But moving on,

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,480
how do we rationalize some of the design decisions

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,000
that have been made that cause some of these problems?

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,833
And actually,

19
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:43,650
this falls back more on implementation teams,

20
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,980
more so than source, pieces of information or data, right?

21
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:50,040
So, this is something we can have much more

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,620
of an immediate effect on

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,890
if we think about it from that perspective.

24
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,470
So, let&#39;s just walk through what we&#39;re going

25
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,203
to talk about in the course of this discussion.

26
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,120
So first we&#39;re going to talk about procedural challenges

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,410
associated with DHIS2 system design.

28
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:08,970
Then, we&#39;re going to discuss the correct value types

29
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:12,493
to be used when we create data elements in DHIS2.

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,180
We&#39;re also going to talk about approaches

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,960
to handle historical data

32
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,250
and deal with historical data completeness.

33
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,540
We&#39;re also going to talk about approaches

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,950
to handle duplicate category options

35
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:26,040
and category option combinations,

36
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,300
which is a relatively large problem

37
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,060
that happens in many implementations.

38
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:32,710
It&#39;s also very common.

39
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,960
So, we&#39;ll talk about that a little bit,

40
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,170
and then we&#39;ll talk about best practices

41
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,293
when managing data dimensions,

42
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,020
the process of identifying duplicate data elements,

43
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,030
and considerations when creating data sets.

44
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,890
So you can see the items I&#39;ve described.

45
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,740
We all have quite a bit of a role to play

46
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,270
when we&#39;re helping anyone set up their system.

47
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,200
These are all things that are ultimately

48
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,160
something we can have a larger impact on immediately

49
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,530
versus some of the issues and challenges that I spoke before

50
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:04,833
about different parts of form design.

51
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,810
So if we look at some of the procedural challenges,

52
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:11,610
and this is kind of a source

53
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,290
of poor system design essentially.

54
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,940
So we often have a lack of procedures

55
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,880
for adding metadata, right?

56
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,120
And this is a big problem

57
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,610
because people just add metadata to wherever they want.

58
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,770
There might not be things like naming conventions,

59
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:30,100
or might not be any type of instruction

60
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,190
on where to do this.

61
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,320
Maybe they do it in their production system directly,

62
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,420
and maybe multiple people do it at the same time

63
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,030
and this is where this second point

64
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,980
on lack of coordination comes in.

65
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,340
So maybe you have two or more administrators

66
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,260
adding the same data sets

67
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,300
and they&#39;re not looking at what actually exists

68
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,920
in their system.

69
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,230
And this can also be a problem

70
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,420
because if you&#39;re hiding lots of metadata,

71
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,610
you&#39;re sharing is incorrect,

72
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,140
which we&#39;ll get to in a moment,

73
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,210
then, if I&#39;m an admin and I&#39;m working on one program

74
00:02:58,210 --> 00:03:01,110
and I don&#39;t see the categories or data elements that exist

75
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:04,550
that can be reused potentially,

76
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,350
then I might create my own

77
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:08,500
and then we&#39;ll have duplicates essentially.

78
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:13,970
The WHO digital data packages also have some impact

79
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,500
on DHIS2 systems and how clean the design can be

80
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,780
and how easy it can be to find data

81
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,820
and the impact of data quality.

82
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,460
And this is because we can potentially introduce

83
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,580
a lot of duplicate metadata

84
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,210
when we import these and install these on our systems.

85
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,330
So something to really strongly consider

86
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:33,750
when we&#39;re doing this.

87
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:37,270
We&#39;re the ones often helping many countries set these up.

88
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:38,150
It&#39;s pretty rare

89
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,080
where these packages are just being set up

90
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,080
without any input from anybody, right?

91
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,100
So, this is something we often have a direct effect on

92
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,633
and it&#39;s something we really need to consider carefully.

93
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:54,270
Another problem is often revisions of data collection forms

94
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,830
over time.

95
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:58,690
So, when we take a look at data collection forms,

96
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,260
and when they get altered with new data elements,

97
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,170
new desegregations, et cetera,

98
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,810
we have to come up with smart ways

99
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,980
to handle this carry over.

100
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,590
And we&#39;ll talk about this a little bit more

101
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:10,670
as we go through this session.

102
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,440
We also often have new objects being added

103
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,750
directly to the production server,

104
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,040
and then they&#39;re abandoned without anybody cleaning this up.

105
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,210
So you get all kinds of data elements,

106
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:24,270
all kinds of different groups maybe,

107
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,330
all kinds of different data sets even,

108
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,690
and they&#39;re never used.

109
00:04:27,690 --> 00:04:29,810
Maybe someone entered a couple of test values for them,

110
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,570
and they&#39;re just completely abandoned.

111
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:34,000
And no one&#39;s really sure why they&#39;re there,

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,180
but over time,

113
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,740
this becomes quite a significant challenge to deal with.

114
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,600
So one of the procedural challenges

115
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,080
that I mentioned was a lack of standard operating procedures

116
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,980
or guidance on how to create metadata.

117
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,820
So I&#39;m actually going to share a couple examples

118
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:52,140
with you about some things that have been done

119
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,100
in other places,

120
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,990
some things that I&#39;ve done,

121
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,900
some things that others have done,

122
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:59,230
to kind of work through this creation of metadata.

123
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,760
And there are some references

124
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,610
that I used as well to create this.

125
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,630
But I think it&#39;s important to have this in place

126
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:08,050
for both aggregate and tracker metadata,

127
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,240
so people are really aware of what that process is.

128
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,120
And this kind of training also goes well beyond

129
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,730
any type of customization training, right?

130
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:18,500
We&#39;re not just discussing with them

131
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,620
where to click and where different things are found,

132
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,180
but after that type of information has been done,

133
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,410
and they kind of understand how to use the interface

134
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:27,690
to add metadata,

135
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:30,680
we&#39;re really focusing on what to do procedurally

136
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,160
and what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong

137
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,360
and the considerations to make

138
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,640
when you&#39;re creating new metadata.

139
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,300
So it&#39;s obviously going a bit beyond

140
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,120
just regular kind of training,

141
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,507
but really thinking about,

142
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:45,320
&quot;If I make an SOP, then I train people exactly on this SOP&quot;

143
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,130
so people understand the process

144
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,770
that we&#39;re putting in place

145
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,820
and everyone&#39;s on board with this, right?

146
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,380
I kind of have in bold on this, if you can see,

147
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,600
that this is to be done on the development server first.

148
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,433
Right?

149
00:05:57,433 --> 00:06:00,290
And I also mentioned this as a particular sticking point

150
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,640
in the presentation,

151
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,780
because you often have people just doing things

152
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,090
directly on production

153
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,190
and this can cause a lot of havoc,

154
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,510
particularly with things like category options

155
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,430
and categories,

156
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,100
especially if you rebuild those

157
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,100
and then things really get out of hand.

158
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,320
So, we have to be really careful how we approach this

159
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,860
and make sure that we can...

160
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,090
This is something I think we have a bit more control

161
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,320
and influence to help countries

162
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,110
in terms of setting up their systems

163
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,510
and making sure we transfer those best practices

164
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:28,710
over to them,

165
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,500
when we&#39;re doing training and capacity building

166
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,400
with them as well.
