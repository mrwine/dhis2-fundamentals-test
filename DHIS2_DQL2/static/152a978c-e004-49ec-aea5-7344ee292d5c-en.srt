00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,270
- [Instructor] So that&#39;s where the next page

1
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:08,120
of the configuration dashboard comes in,

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,790
the configuration tool comes in

3
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,760
and that is to change these thresholds.

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:17,760
So I&#39;m gonna show you how that&#39;s done, more administration.

5
00:00:20,415 --> 00:00:25,415
This page is really quite complex and a bit overwhelming.

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:29,450
Fortunately, the tool does a good job

7
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:32,410
of filling it in by default.

8
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:37,410
So if you leave the default settings,

9
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:41,953
then that usually works pretty well.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,940
Now what I&#39;m looking for and completeness,

11
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,270
I&#39;m looking for how to reset the thresholds

12
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,500
or data consistency.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,810
Maybe it was under numerator relations.

14
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:05,643
Oh yeah.

15
00:01:05,643 --> 00:01:06,723
Okay, sorry.

16
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:12,350
That&#39;s 10% I was talking about.

17
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,660
It isn&#39;t set with the numerator quality parameters.

18
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,410
It is actually set in numerator relations

19
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:22,520
and notice here that when you fill this in,

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:27,450
that&#39;s when you set this, when I set it to 10%.

21
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,330
So by default it says 10%.

22
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:35,330
I&#39;m gonna loosen this and set the threshold to 30%

23
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,680
and let&#39;s see what we find when we change this threshold.

24
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:47,810
We go back to the dashboard and consistency data.

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,390
Now we&#39;ve got a wider set of thresholds

26
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,300
for consistency between ANC 1 and Penta 1.

27
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,450
And there&#39;s only the single only bow

28
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:06,373
as ANC first visit number.

29
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:11,600
Again, this is set for last 12 months.

30
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,720
So ANC is much greater than,

31
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,320
the ANC 1 much greater than Penta 1.

32
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,170
And these other districts are not flagged

33
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,713
as having outlier values.

34
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,740
That&#39;s how you set the thresholds for numerator relations.

35
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,822
You actually do it when you complete the form.

36
00:02:37,822 --> 00:02:41,240
And maybe even with dropout, well dropout rate,

37
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:45,920
you don&#39;t set a threshold, but with each one of these,

38
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,920
you can decide what to set the threshold at.

39
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,380
For example, I like to adjust the threshold

40
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,880
so that you have only

41
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,140
a small manageable number of districts

42
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,980
which are flagged as having outliers

43
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,300
so that you can easily follow up

44
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,300
on that small manageable number of districts.

45
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,300
But other aspects of these quality parameters are set here

46
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,260
and there are so many aspects.

47
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,260
And in a moment, we&#39;ll share a PowerPoint presentation

48
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,670
that Nick has developed just briefly shift points to it

49
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:33,000
to help you understand what is meant

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,620
by expected trend constant versus increasing decreasing

51
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,340
compare with overall result versus expected result.

52
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,620
That&#39;s what the PowerPoint will go into.

53
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,490
What I&#39;m going to show you is how even the definition

54
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:56,490
of what is an outlier using standard Z scores,

55
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,560
you can change that in the tool.

56
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,560
And as an example with malaria cases,

57
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:10,010
you might find that because malaria is seasonal,

58
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:15,010
you want to pick up only quite extreme values for malaria.

59
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,050
So you could change the definition of a moderate outlier

60
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:26,050
to three standard deviations and the severe extreme outlier

61
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,090
to four standard deviations.

62
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:34,090
So this is something in your spare time to play around with.

63
00:04:37,249 --> 00:04:42,249
And just one tip that I have about setting these parameters.

64
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,970
What I like to do is even though I,

65
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:51,020
sometimes I&#39;m not quite understanding

66
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,610
what the distinction is

67
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,780
between expected results and overall result.

68
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:58,550
I like to just play around with these,

69
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,582
go into numerator quality parameters

70
00:05:01,582 --> 00:05:06,582
and see how it affects the dashboard.

71
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,900
Is the reference line going through mode,

72
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:17,250
most of the dots or is the reference line misplaced?

73
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,023
For example, if we, let&#39;s with IPT.

74
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:30,400
Let&#39;s go to quality parameters.

75
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:35,620
And if we set this to expected results

76
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,170
and we looked at the dashboard, it&#39;s not a core.

77
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:49,160
Okay, it&#39;s not a core because it&#39;s a malaria indicator.

78
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,780
Okay, yeah so this is what I was doing.

79
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:56,780
Notice how when it&#39;s set to expected result,

80
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,290
the line is below all these dots.

81
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:06,050
So what I like to do is as I say,

82
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,050
play around with the quality parameters.

83
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:17,060
And if we change this back to expected result,

84
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,080
oh, I forgot something.

85
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,090
This is, if you like, it&#39;s a bug of the tool.

86
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,730
Most parts of the configuration you don&#39;t have to save,

87
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:34,730
but this page you have to save or you don&#39;t see the effects.

88
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:45,433
So let&#39;s see if this has changed the situation.

89
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,660
Okay well, so now it&#39;s still below.

90
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:01,210
I&#39;m just gonna persist with this once more

91
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,293
and then I&#39;ll move on or pause for questions.

92
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:07,323
Let&#39;s see.

93
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,313
So I&#39;ve saved.

94
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,553
All right.

95
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:17,190
Oh, no, I&#39;m sorry.

96
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:19,560
I forgot to set that (indistinct)

97
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,450
Now, okay.

98
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,450
So we find that indeed overall results produces

99
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,050
the reference line which passes through most of the dots.

100
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,140
We assume that most of the dots

101
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,500
are the appropriate relationship.

102
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,500
And we just have a couple of outliers of suspicious numbers.

103
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:50,090
So I&#39;ll point too and maybe Nick wants to say something

104
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,133
about the presentation.

105
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:04,503
Do you see the PowerPoint presentation on the screen now?

106
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,650
- [Nick] Yep, yes.

107
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:09,810
I mean, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll get

108
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:12,350
into too much detail on that presentation.

109
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:15,060
It&#39;s just there for your reference.

110
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:18,140
It kind of explains the link

111
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,470
between some of these numerator quality presenters

112
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,720
and their effect then on, in particular,

113
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,870
the analysis functions.

114
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,660
So there is some stuff in the analysis functions

115
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,500
we didn&#39;t go over in too much detail,

116
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,400
but just some of these terms that you see

117
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:37,400
in their expected results or overall results,

118
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,520
as well as increasing and decreasing

119
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,650
when you&#39;re setting these thresholds

120
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:44,050
as well as all the different analysis

121
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:47,060
that you could perform and basically just goes over

122
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,670
the effect of what you&#39;re doing on this.

123
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:54,453
So just real quick you had expected an overall result.

124
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:59,300
Expected result is kind of a theoretical result.

125
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,790
It&#39;s usually if you&#39;re, for example,

126
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,170
if I&#39;m doing an analysis over time, maybe I expect them.

127
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,650
If there are two variables that are comparing

128
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,160
the ratio, maybe should be one, right?

129
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,450
Maybe they&#39;re equal.

130
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:10,740
But then there&#39;s an observed result

131
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,600
and actual results right?

132
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,660
Not my theoretical actual result at your national level.

133
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,040
So that&#39;s the observed results, right?

134
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,580
Where you&#39;re actually seeing, okay,

135
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,290
if I compare two values at the national level,

136
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,820
what is my observed result?

137
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:25,890
And then I can take all the districts

138
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,960
or facilities or whatever and compare them

139
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,700
to that observed result.

140
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,920
So it&#39;s just kind of a, you know,

141
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,170
the tool does various things to model information,

142
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:40,250
pieces of information for you to kind of compare

143
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,820
and contrast how things are.

144
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,630
And sometimes this modeling

145
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:47,700
is based on ideal scenarios, right?

146
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,830
So you might not accurately reflect

147
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,330
what you&#39;re observing in reality.

148
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,770
So that&#39;s kind of the briefly,

149
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:57,570
the difference between this observed and expected results.

150
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:00,790
Just reviewing in a theoretical value

151
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,280
versus a actual observed value based on values

152
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,540
in your system.

153
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,640
I don&#39;t know where that theoretical value can help.

154
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,740
Obviously is where your data

155
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,580
is just completely stuck, right?

156
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,710
So if you have a lot of problems with your data

157
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,130
and then the observed result does not give you value,

158
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:18,300
you know, there&#39;s no added value in comparing districts

159
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,230
to that observed value because there&#39;s significant issues

160
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,100
with the data quality that you&#39;re already aware of.

161
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,100
That&#39;s where that theoretical value for the expected results

162
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,730
would be better to use.

163
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,000
But in any case, I think this is a bit of a

164
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:39,190
that way down in the weeds about how to look at this.

165
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:41,070
You know, you can have a look if you&#39;re interested

166
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,700
and I&#39;m happy to speak to anyone

167
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,110
who has any follow up about this,

168
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,260
but I don&#39;t wanna detract from the overall discussion.

169
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,870
So you can just have a look at the session in leisure

170
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:52,603
and we can talk about this more if you have any questions.

171
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,810
- [Instructor] Yeah, thanks Nick.

172
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:57,410
And if nothing else,

173
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,410
I encourage you to play around with those who have access

174
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:09,110
to the configuration of the tool.

175
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:13,800
See what happens when you change these parameters.

176
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,910
What happens to the chart?

177
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,440
And once you have figured out

178
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:25,300
what gives you the most useful chart,

179
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:29,870
then you can just leave that setting there

180
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:33,050
and not feel like you have to explain

181
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:38,050
to people about what the, what these parameters mean.

182
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,720
These thresholds for completeness and timeliness,

183
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,743
they don&#39;t actually appear on the dashboard.

184
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:55,410
These are thresholds that will appear in the annual report

185
00:11:56,930 --> 00:12:01,373
that can be generated automatically.

186
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:09,477
And we&#39;ve covered a good deal of topics here.

187
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,700
And I want to have a moment of silence if nothing else,

188
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:19,760
to encourage someone to raise their hand

189
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:22,877
and ask about any of these issues.

190
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,730
This comparison of one data element to another program,

191
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:49,120
people often find this very attractive feature.

192
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,120
And instead of adding more comparisons to the dashboard,

193
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,210
what you can encourage them to do

194
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:02,940
is learn how to use the analysis function,

195
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,890
analysis, consistency and once they figure out

196
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:12,890
how to set this up, then how to find

197
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,783
the data element that they&#39;re most interested in.

198
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:24,583
So we&#39;re going to, let&#39;s see.

199
00:13:28,635 --> 00:13:33,635
Then they can do analysis to their heart&#39;s content.

200
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:39,453
So for me, it&#39;s a way of relieving pressure

201
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:45,700
on configuration of the dashboard

202
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:49,200
&#39;cause you want the dashboard to run efficiently

203
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,373
and it won&#39;t.

204
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,320
I&#39;m not sure how I selected by accident

205
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,900
acute flaccid paralysis

206
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,940
but there&#39;s no relationship between treatment of pneumonia

207
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:08,940
and acute flaccid paralysis which shouldn&#39;t surprise us.

208
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:14,640
But the point is that there&#39;s no limits to the analysis

209
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:20,350
that can be done with the analysis tool.

210
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:25,350
Unfortunately, there&#39;s no way to save this configuration.

211
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,020
And hopefully with a future version

212
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:33,570
of the data quality tool, there, there will be favorites.

213
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,570
So this can be in a certain group of favorites

214
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,440
of the child health group, and then others can easily,

215
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,470
without going through all these steps

216
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:51,990
of hunting for the data element,

217
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:56,143
they can generate the comparison and look at the

218
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,810
and drill down all of the things

219
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:02,650
that we talked about on Monday

220
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,323
with the using the analysis function.
