<p>Correct options are B, C, and D. Deleting metadata is difficult and there is often little feedback on what is happening. The maintenance app is currently not well suited to make large batch changes. Nested searches for specific items is correct because  we can not find all data elements within a tracker program easily for example. Option A is incorrect because we can use category option groups and group sets to hide this, even if we can't solve the underlying problem immediately.</p>
