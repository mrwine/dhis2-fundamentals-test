<h3>Validation Rules and Notifications</h3>

<p class= "text">In this video, Scott introduces Validation Rules for Data Quality. Youâ€™ll start by looking at the logic of Validation Rules, see an example how validation rules are set up, and learn how to configure validation rules to trigger Data Quality alerts and notifications that can be sent to DHIS2 users by email, SMS and other channels to inform them of Data Quality issues.</p>

<p class= "text">Below the video, you will find a set of graded exercises that you will need to pass in order to complete the course.</p>

<p class= "text"><i>If you would like to follow along and replicate the instructor in DHIS2, please use the updated <a href="https://academy.dq.dhis2.org/dq-config" target= "blank">DHIS2 Data Quality Config</a> Training instance for validation rule practice rather than the old link from this presentation. </i></p>
