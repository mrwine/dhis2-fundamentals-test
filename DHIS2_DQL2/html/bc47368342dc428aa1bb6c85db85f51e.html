<h3>What’s In This Module?</h3> 
<p class= "text">Data Quality issues can often be caused during the data capture process. How can you avoid these issues? What DHIS2 tools and methods can you use to prevent these issues before they occur?<p> 
<p class= "text">In this module, you will learn useful tips for working with individual-level (Tracker) data in DHIS2 to support better data quality in capturing Tracker data. First, Yury Rogachev, a specialist on Tracker implementation, will show you <b>how to move Tracker data to aggregate data sets</b>, and you will present scripts that you can use to <b>map useful data from the imported data</b>.</p>
<p class= "text">Then, Scott will show you how you can implement good data quality in Tracker Programs by learning how to <b>create and use program rules and indicators to ensure good data quality in the data capture process</b>.</p>  
<h3>Learning objectives</h3>
<p class= "text">By the end of the module you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Import Tracker data to aggregate data sets</li>
  <li>Turn the tracker data into aggregate data using an aggregate script</li>
  <li>Create a program rule for good data quality</li>
  <li>Identify how program indicators work to ensure good Data Quality</li>
</ul>

<h3>How will you be evaluated?</h3>
<p class= "text">There is a short graded quiz to test your understanding of Program Rules and Data quality issues in Tracker. You’ll need to pass this quiz in order to gain your certificate of completion for the course. This graded quiz contributes 10% to your final grade.</p>
<h3>How long will this module take?</h3>
<p class= "text">This module should take about <b>1 hours 20 min</b> to complete.</p>
