(upbeat music)

1
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:08,610
- [Bob] WHO defines four dimensions

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:10,740
or domains of data quality

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:13,020
which you see presented here,

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,370
completeness, internal consistency,

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,230
which means do even the data agree with each other?

6
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:22,580
External consistency,

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,720
does the data reported by health facilities

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,050
agree with data from other sources,

9
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,930
such as a health facility survey,

10
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:35,310
and finally a review of the consistency of the denominators

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,880
of the population estimates

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,460
that are used to calculate coverage.

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,683
So I&#39;m going to review each of these four domains in turn.

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,080
You see here a chart that is showing the trend

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,710
over the last 12 months

16
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,893
in the reporting completeness for two different datasets.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:00,540
It&#39;s possible with a single chart like this,

18
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:04,693
to show the trend for multiple datasets,

19
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,700
completeness, reporting rates,

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,200
this is the most fundamental aspect of data quality.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,090
And before you attempt to interpret any trend

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,920
in the data themselves,

23
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,907
you have to look at what is the trend

24
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:24,907
and the percentage of completeness of the data.

25
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,170
Internal consistency, what do we mean by that?

26
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,710
Well, you could think of this internal consistency

27
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,890
as the apparent accuracy of the data

28
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:40,220
comparing one aspect of the data

29
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:44,230
with another aspect of the same dataset.

30
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:46,530
And there are several different ways

31
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,210
of measuring this internal consistency

32
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,863
at a way of measuring is here referred to as a metric.

33
00:01:53,917 --> 00:01:57,300
If there&#39;s one metric which is the consistency over time

34
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,333
that is our data that consistent from month to month.

35
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:07,600
B, the second metric is consistency between indicators

36
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:12,660
that are related and the commonest example of this

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:17,660
is to assess what we refer to as the DPT dropout rates

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,210
are the reported numbers of first doses of Penta vaccine,

39
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:28,840
consistent with the numbers of third doses of Penta vaccine.

40
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,780
And we&#39;ll provide some other examples of related indicators.

41
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,620
And finally, there&#39;s a form of internal consistency,

42
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:40,380
which can only be measured by visiting the health facility

43
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,490
as I&#39;ve referred to.

44
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:45,800
And that is the consistency between clinic registers

45
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,290
and reported data and in that way,

46
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,923
we can measure something called the verification factor.

47
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,640
This is an example of the type of chart

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,350
which we can use to look at to month consistency of data.

49
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,183
In this case,

50
00:03:02,183 --> 00:03:05,603
the number of reported third doses of Penta vaccine,

51
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,340
and each of these lines represents

52
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,820
the trend over the 12 month period.

53
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:16,760
And the Penta 3 doses for one region.

54
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,373
The blue line is region one.

55
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,860
And the blue line in particular has this hump here,

56
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,700
which unlike the data front of the other regions

57
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,690
suggests there&#39;s a certain inconsistency

58
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,940
from month to month

59
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,870
that this has jumped up in a way that we don&#39;t quite see

60
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,360
with the data from the other regions.

61
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,080
However, when we&#39;re looking at data

62
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,000
at the level of a region, we can&#39;t be sure,

63
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,910
is this due to a data quality issue

64
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:51,200
or does it represent an actual increase in services?

65
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,640
But look what happens

66
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,570
when we actually look at these trend lines

67
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,593
for individual districts?

68
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,580
So here we see the data from the same country

69
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,260
and from region one, but in this case,

70
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,370
there&#39;s one line for each of the districts of region one.

71
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:13,220
And there&#39;s a certain amount of instability

72
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,600
from month to month in the indicators.

73
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,600
But look at this line for district number 12,

74
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,580
where in the month of June

75
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,510
the reported third doses of Penta has more than doubled

76
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:30,020
and then it drops back down again.

77
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,550
This is highly suspicious.

78
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,020
And the lesson here is that

79
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,210
when you&#39;re looking for month to month inconsistency,

80
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,750
it&#39;s best to look at the data that are desegregated

81
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:43,140
to the level of the district.

82
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,310
And then you&#39;re more likely to pick up

83
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,390
these quite suspicious numbers

84
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,410
and have confidence that it is a data quality issue.

85
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,100
In fact, with DHIS 2, it&#39;s possible to drill down,

86
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,080
to go down to an even lower level

87
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,540
and identify the specific health facility,

88
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:06,440
which has reported this suspicious number.

89
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,090
And I think you would agree with me

90
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,720
that when we look at these lines for each of the doses

91
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,720
of a vaccine for this health center number two

92
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,200
of the same district of the same region,

93
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,760
we see that this jump in the value for the region

94
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,770
is actually due to a single number

95
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:31,080
reported by this health center in June.

96
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:35,760
And we can also see that this is almost certainly an error.

97
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,320
This is due to a data quality issue.

98
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,320
Not only has the typical value of less than a hundred

99
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:49,950
of the typical value of Penta 3 jumped to 3,749,

100
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,110
but we see that this health center in the same month

101
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:59,500
has reported normal consistent values

102
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,410
for the other data elements.

103
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:04,910
So here we see an example of an erroneous value

104
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,683
that has been reported for one health facility.

105
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,720
This slide shows you the table that is generated

106
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,700
by the WHO data quality tool

107
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,430
to automatically identify facilities and values like this

108
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,780
that are extremely suspicious,

109
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:28,430
and which are almost certainly due to errors

110
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,750
that have been entered into the DHIS two.

111
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:36,510
In this case, it has sorted these values

112
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:40,350
and put up at the top of our table,

113
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:45,350
the 12 months of data for Kawe Dispensary

114
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:50,030
data on Penta vaccine doses given

115
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:52,180
in females under one dose three.

116
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,180
And it has found that this number is the most extreme

117
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,420
and most suspicious value of all

118
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,200
in all of the immunization datasets,

119
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,590
and we&#39;ll practice with this WHO data quality tool

120
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,170
and see how it can be used to rapidly

121
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:15,053
and automatically identify such outliers.

122
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,770
The next type of internal consistency

123
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,340
that we will be reviewing is

124
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:26,420
as I said, consistency of related indicators.

125
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:30,160
And here&#39;s some other examples of related indicators.

126
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,200
In addition to looking at the dropout rate

127
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,930
between Penta 1 and Penta 3.

128
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,930
We could also compare the values of the first doses of Penta

129
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,660
to values of the first doses of OPV vaccine.

130
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,310
Both of these are typically administered on the same visit.

131
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:53,150
So we expect the values of these two indicators

132
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,820
to be roughly the same.

133
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,000
And then a final example.

134
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,990
The data on confirmed cases are frequently reported

135
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:06,950
both in the monthly outpatient department report

136
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:11,880
and reported in the malaria lab test report

137
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,050
that is submitted each month.

138
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:17,770
So we could compare confirmed outpatient cases

139
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:22,770
to the total number of positive RDT and microscopy tests

140
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,923
that were reported in a given month.

141
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:32,940
The slide here shows how the WHO data quality tool

142
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,460
analyzes for the dropout rate between DPT 1 and DPT 3

143
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,680
and it generates this type of chart

144
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:45,640
showing that there&#39;s one particular district,

145
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,200
which had a negative dropout rate,

146
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,140
which if reported for a full year

147
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,283
is usually a sign of a data quality problem.

148
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,100
External consistency,

149
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,370
I&#39;ll just quickly review these last two dimensions,

150
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,630
which aren&#39;t a major focus of this workshop.

151
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:10,170
Here&#39;s an example of how the WHO data quality tool

152
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,500
has compared the values

153
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:16,140
reported on a house household survey.

154
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,870
In this case, this was a demographic health survey,

155
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,740
the values for anti-natal care first visit coverage

156
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:28,290
reported on the survey versus what was estimated

157
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:32,020
based upon the data reported by health facilities.

158
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,660
And in this case, there&#39;s a striking difference

159
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,700
between what is called the routine estimated coverage

160
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,140
coverage that is calculated with health facility data

161
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,663
and the estimates based on the household survey.

162
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,780
And finally, consistency of population estimates

163
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,290
or denominator estimates.

164
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,330
There&#39;s a couple of things that should be assessed

165
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,450
about the denominators.

166
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:02,230
One is whether they are consistent from year to year,

167
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:05,050
and the second is whether related denominators,

168
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:07,140
such as the number of pregnancies,

169
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,410
the number of live births, the number of infants

170
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,490
are consistent between each other.

171
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:16,840
So here&#39;s a chart giving an example of a country,

172
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,270
which has not had year to year consistency

173
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:25,140
and the growth rate of the number of surviving infants

174
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,810
the population under one.

175
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:31,810
In fact, that estimated number under population under one

176
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,820
is seem to have dropped from 2015 to 2016,

177
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,120
and then it increased dramatically from 2017 to 2018.

178
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,670
So this estimated value

179
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:49,180
is not showing year to year consistency.

180
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:53,000
And similarly, if you think about it,

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,580
it is a bit unusual that we would find

182
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,580
that the estimated number of surviving infants

183
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,670
in 2018 and 2019, was estimated to be actually greater

184
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,760
than the estimated number of live births

185
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:14,040
that really should not happen at national level

186
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,920
and suggests that we had some errors in the denominators

187
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,835
used to calculate coverage.

188
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:22,418
(upbeat music)
