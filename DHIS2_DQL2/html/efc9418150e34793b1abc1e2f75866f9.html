<h3>Exercise Part 1: Using Predictor Rules to Identify Outliers</h3>
<p class= "text">In the first part of this exercise, you will practice how to configure predictors for outlier detection. Follow the steps below to create and run your predictor. If you would like additional information on why predictors are used to calculate outliers in DHIS2 and step-by-step guidance on how to complete Part 1 of this exercise, you can review the <a href="/static/3.2.2_HowToUsePredictorRulesToIdentifyOutliers.pdf" target= "blank">How to Use Predictors to Identify Outliers</a> document.</p>
<ol>
  <li>  Create a Data Element to store the predicted value for ANC1 Outlier Threshold. Call the data element <i>ANC1 Outlier Threshold – YourName (Ex: ANC1 Outlier Threshold – Scott)</i></li>
  <li>Create a Predictor that calculates the ANC outlier threshold. Call the Predictor: <i>ANC1 Outlier Threshold – YourName</i></li>
  <li>  Run your Predictor. Follow the instructions that are available in the How to Use Predictors to Identify Outliers document for guidance on how to verify that your Predictor has run successfully in the DHIS2 Data Quality Config instance.</li>
