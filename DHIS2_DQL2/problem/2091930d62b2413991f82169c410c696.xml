<p>Explanation</p>

<p>The correct answer is C-6. From the data table, we see that this has a higher modified z-score then other districts that have identified outliers for BCG given less then 1. This z-scores help us determine how much these outlier valies deviate from the other reported values within a given period. The higher the z-score, the higher the deviation.</p>
