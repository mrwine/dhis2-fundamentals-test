00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,330
- [Pamod] In this session, what we are going to discuss

1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:07,690
is about Data Quality Practices in Sri Lanka.

2
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:10,540
So, what I hope to do in this session is that,

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:13,340
I will be taking two examples,

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,250
two implementations in Sri Lanka.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,750
One is from the RMNCAH program,

6
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,390
and the other one is from the nutrition program.

7
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,950
And I&#39;m going to discuss how these elements

8
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,070
of ensuring data quality has been applied

9
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,143
in these two implementations.

10
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:32,450
So the first scenario,

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,510
or the first use case that I&#39;m going to talk about

12
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:38,240
is the RMNCAH program in Sri Lanka.

13
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,080
So this in fact, was one of the major DHS implementations

14
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,600
in Sri Lanka, and it took us a lot of efforts

15
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,370
to get this implemented.

16
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,430
The main reason being,

17
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:52,570
the paper-based data collection system of RMNCAH

18
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:54,720
has been a well-established system

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,050
for more than three decades.

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,680
So trying to introduce a digital system,

21
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,432
and also trying to ensure at least the minimum data quality

22
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:05,100
that was already there in the paper-based system

23
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,470
was a major challenge.

24
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,470
So let us see how we apply these concepts of data quality

25
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:14,020
while we were planning the implementation.

26
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,910
So we might feel that ensuring data quality

27
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:19,630
is a very complicated task,

28
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,903
but I will show you how simple you can start.

29
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,930
So for example, the first thing that we did was,

30
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:28,480
we concentrated about data quality

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,810
while we were designing the data entry forms.

32
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:34,970
So one simple step that we ensured was that,

33
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:37,970
because we were trying to introduce this digital system

34
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,310
to an already existing paper-based system,

35
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,650
we tried to adhere to the well-established data flows.

36
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:47,320
In simple words, what we tried to do is,

37
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,970
the data entry interfaces or the data forms,

38
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,830
in the DHIS2, the datasets,

39
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:56,280
we tried to make the use interfaces as much as similar

40
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,900
to the existing paper-based format.

41
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,320
I mean, we always say

42
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,010
that you have to optimize the data collection forms.

43
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,770
But while ensuring that,

44
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,380
we tried to keep the flow of the data,

45
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,270
the order in which it appear,

46
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:10,960
the same as how it is in data entry forms.

47
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,580
So by doing that, we can minimize the random errors

48
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:17,170
that data entry people might do,

49
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,360
because they just have to follow the same workflow

50
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,890
that they are doing while entering data into paper formats.

51
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:26,520
So for this instance,

52
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,860
what we created was a custom data entry form,

53
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,490
not a section or standard DHIS2 dataset,

54
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,920
but it was a custom form.

55
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,620
So let me show you, first of all,

56
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,600
now this is the paper format that we had in the RMNCAH,

57
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,530
the main aggregate data collection form.

58
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:42,380
You can see it&#39;s a very complicated form.

59
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:46,160
There are so many data items or data elements.

60
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,360
And of course, most of these columns that you see here

61
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,320
are the periods.

62
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,627
So the columns of course, do not come into this,

63
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:56,260
our data entry interface, but what I&#39;m talking here

64
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,210
is about having this same model as how it is appearing

65
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,360
in the paper format.

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,260
And we had the same workflow,

67
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,370
while we did the transition to the digital format.

68
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:12,270
So here what you&#39;re seeing is our DHIS2 custom dataset,

69
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:16,350
or data entry form, and please excuse me for the language.

70
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:17,950
The forms are in local language,

71
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,400
but what I want to highlight is the same order

72
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,270
that we have it in the data format,

73
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:27,000
we have been following in DHIS2 dataset as well.

74
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,700
Even though we have done some slight modifications,

75
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,520
for example, we have set up here the vertical tabs

76
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,660
to capture this large amount of data,

77
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,660
but the flow of information capture remains the same.

78
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,380
And the next thing is,

79
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,500
sometimes when we are designing forms,

80
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,564
we cannot actually replicate the paper forms into the DHIS2.

81
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,010
There are some optimizations that we have to do,

82
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:54,290
especially like there are things

83
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,240
like duplicate data collection,

84
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,300
and there are so many things that we don&#39;t do

85
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,050
in an optimum way in paper-based collection,

86
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,400
but which we can optimize

87
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,720
when we are creating the datasets in DHIS2.

88
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,370
So for example, in the mental health system,

89
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:12,470
this is the paper form that we are using.

90
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,703
But when we were trying to convert that into DHIS2,

91
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,690
what we actually did was, we optimized the data form.

92
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,500
And at the same time, we had the opportunity of modifying

93
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,030
the existing paper-based data collection form,

94
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,960
so that it kind of added to the quality of data

95
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,030
that is collected.

96
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,990
For example, now this is the modified paper-based form

97
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,350
that we were able to create,

98
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,150
because when we&#39;ve been one step ahead,

99
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,560
this is the DHIS2-based data collection form.

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,730
So to minimally confuse the users

101
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,950
and at the point of generation of data,

102
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,620
we tried to use the same data collection form

103
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,120
as we have been in DHIS2.

104
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:54,953
So what we did was,

105
00:04:54,953 --> 00:04:58,280
we kind of modified the existing paper-based form

106
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,943
to be an optimized paper form.

107
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,230
This is another example of the same mental health system,

108
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,430
where we have optimized the data collection forms, right?

109
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,290
And sometimes, of course, in this RHMIS system

110
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,950
there were requirements such as like,

111
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,610
when we wanted to collect these WHO MNH Indicators,

112
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,070
we did not have a paper-based form to start with.

113
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,830
So there of course, we had the luxury of designing

114
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,950
of a paper-based form also from the scratch,

115
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:32,830
which was kind of easy because this is the DHIS2 dataset,

116
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:34,870
or rather the event form.

117
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,040
And that one, based on that one,

118
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,500
so when designing that one,

119
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,980
we were able to follow the best practices.

120
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:45,380
And then we came back and we designed a new paper form

121
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,670
for the collection of data,

122
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:50,680
because most of the institutes

123
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,270
that are involved with our MCH system,

124
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:56,750
they do not capture the data, the electronic system

125
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:57,970
at the point of generation.

126
00:05:57,970 --> 00:06:00,850
So usually the data entry happens on a paper-based form,

127
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:03,763
and then that is copied into the DHIS2.

128
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,280
Right, and I mean, for the expanding on this,

129
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,053
one thing that we had to make sure,

130
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,720
like when we are having this digital transformation

131
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,926
from paper system to the electronic system

132
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:21,576
is to minimally interrupt the workflow.

133
00:06:21,576 --> 00:06:23,660
Because the thing is, I think that should be the context

134
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,851
of most of the countries,

135
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:29,108
because you may have a well-established paper format.

136
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:31,796
And when you are trying to introduce the digital system,

137
00:06:31,796 --> 00:06:34,969
we should try to minimally disrupt the existing data flow.

138
00:06:34,969 --> 00:06:38,695
It&#39;s like, the government&#39;s motive

139
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:42,760
is to provide better health, not only data.

140
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,790
So if you are just trying to enhance the data,

141
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,440
I mean, the quality of data

142
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,910
by introducing the digital system,

143
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:51,743
and at the same time,

144
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:54,710
if you are kind of disrupting an existing data flow,

145
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,700
that will have a lot of resistance during the implementation

146
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,410
from so many stakeholders.

147
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,620
So the other thing that we tried to do with this is that,

148
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,720
in our paper-based system in Sri Lanka,

149
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,080
we had these different approval levels.

150
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,300
So those were inherent data quality measures

151
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,693
that were there at field levels.

152
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:16,280
So when we were introducing DHIS2, what we did was,

153
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,570
we did not try to capture data to the digital system

154
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:20,830
just at the same time.

155
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,240
So we preserved the paper-based system and we kind of,

156
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,720
as they have to copy the data that is captured

157
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,930
in the paper-based system into the digital system,

158
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:32,807
and also the approval workflows that were already there,

159
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:33,640
we tried to implement the DHIS2,

160
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,560
so that there was one step verification

161
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,460
before the data goes higher up along the health hierarchy.

162
00:07:41,787 --> 00:07:44,130
So that the data approval workflows

163
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,657
was a major contribute in factor,

164
00:07:47,657 --> 00:07:49,140
ensuring data quality in the CRHIMS

165
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,853
or the digital MCH system.

166
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,740
We conducted the training programs.

167
00:07:57,740 --> 00:08:00,100
In fact like, well, what you&#39;re seeing here

168
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,580
is one of our field level training program,

169
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,270
and the person who was in the front

170
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:09,210
is the one who was leading this entire MCH system

171
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:11,150
Dr. Kaushal, I think she&#39;s a participant

172
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,247
in this academy also.

173
00:08:12,247 --> 00:08:15,290
We are so much grateful to her and her team

174
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,650
for implementing all of this, the data quality practices

175
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,660
in her system.

176
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,030
So here the data quality measures

177
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:24,910
and how they should capture data, and at that point,

178
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:28,300
how to ensure data quality was an inherent component

179
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,640
during these training programs

180
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,510
that we conducted at field level.

181
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:33,883
So what we did was we had a national team,

182
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,600
we&#39;re kind of master trainers,

183
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,080
and we were able to replicate the training programs

184
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:43,030
using our trainers who are at a field level.

185
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:46,260
So all these training programs had a special emphasis

186
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,600
on ensuring data quality.

187
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,170
Like for example, especially at the point of generation,

188
00:08:53,170 --> 00:08:54,700
point of capture of data,

189
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,400
there were so many data quality measures,

190
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,720
which I will be showing you in non-exclusive slides.

191
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,979
So they have a special emphasis that we put on data quality

192
00:09:01,979 --> 00:09:04,029
during this and use the training program.

193
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,940
And one other thing about ensuring data quality

194
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,140
is to have proper user manual, so SOPs.

195
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,960
The thing is like the DHIS2

196
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,710
has its own extensive user guide,

197
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:25,170
which like I&#39;m sure that they confuse many end-users

198
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:27,470
if you just ask these end-users to refer

199
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,360
the DHIS2 user manual which is available online.

200
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,680
So that of course didn&#39;t work and we realized that.

201
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,870
So what we did was we created the end-user manual,

202
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,480
which is of course it&#39;s a very comprehensive end-user manual

203
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,310
with the screenshots and also like explaining everything

204
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:47,200
in very simple manner

205
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,390
which could be comprehended by end-users.

206
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,210
So this end-user manual was something that we handed over

207
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:55,723
to the end-users during our training programs,

208
00:09:56,750 --> 00:10:00,750
which they can keep at their work places and they can refer.

209
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,583
But the thing is like,

210
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,990
this is a kind of a comprehensive user manual,

211
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:07,170
which maybe a bit too much

212
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:10,220
when you are just trying to find something real quick

213
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,900
when you are entering data at your desk.

214
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,090
So for that purpose, we had another type of manual,

215
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:18,590
which I&#39;ll show you in a while.

216
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:21,770
And the other thing is, there were so many SOPs

217
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:25,640
that we created before we tried to implement the system.

218
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,910
Because like, we understood initially

219
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,810
that when you are having this digital transformation

220
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,030
from paper-based system,

221
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,970
which was kind of list I&#39;ve issued to the digital system,

222
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:39,340
there may be a lot of resistance that we might encounter

223
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,700
because for the simple reason

224
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,940
that users don&#39;t like too much of change.

225
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:48,940
So we try to simplify everything so that to make sure

226
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,300
that the end-users don&#39;t see this learning curve

227
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,890
as a very difficult one.

228
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,680
So this is where we had different levels of SOPs.

229
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,550
So this one that you&#39;re seeing is a checklist

230
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,320
that all the facilities should have

231
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,840
before entering data into the system.

232
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:08,090
So here we try to explain everything in a simple way,

233
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,990
and this we have asked them to keep

234
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,120
by the side of the computer that they&#39;re using

235
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,953
for data entry.

236
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,550
But the one that we have asked them

237
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:21,270
either to keep at all times next to their computers

238
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:25,410
or else to paste it on the wall where they&#39;re entering data

239
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,370
is this ones.

240
00:11:26,370 --> 00:11:31,250
So these are single page end-user manuals or SOPs

241
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:35,670
that we have created just specifically to given tasks.

242
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:39,280
So these kinds of, I mean like how this helps

243
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,470
in data quality is that the thing is like,

244
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:46,070
if you perceive using a system as a kind of a difficult one,

245
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:47,680
then there is high chance that,

246
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,500
I mean, that&#39;s this is what we have seen,

247
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,190
that there is a high chance that they might make mistakes.

248
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:57,190
So having these specific SOPs and the use of manuals

249
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:01,460
with the end-users kind of really contributed

250
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,470
to ensuring the perceptive ease of use of this system,

251
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:09,810
which of course contributed to the data quality in the end.

252
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,000
So these kinds of manuals or SOPs

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,090
we had for each of these tasks,

254
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,820
and this is exactly what we followed there

255
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,250
in our COVID implementation,

256
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:20,350
which was kind of a rapid implementation from the learnings

257
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:23,570
that we had from other MCH system.

258
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,120
And this is another single page user document

259
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,470
that the MCH system is using.

260
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:35,470
And then, we also tried to use

261
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:38,520
remote administration software.

262
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,200
So remote desktop softwares like TeamViwer.

263
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,670
Because like, how it really contributed us

264
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:45,723
in ensuring data quality is that,

265
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,040
what we saw was that

266
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,860
when we are trying to provide support to end-users,

267
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,730
there were some issues where they cannot actually explain

268
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:55,050
even on the phone.

269
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:58,990
So if they actually cannot solve their problem,

270
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,330
they try to enter data which might be a radiance, right?

271
00:13:03,330 --> 00:13:05,500
Because if they would assume

272
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,870
that this would be the proper way of using,

273
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,020
and which is not exactly the correct thing.

274
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:14,470
So here we are using TeamViwer as a tool

275
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,420
where we can connect from national level

276
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,640
to the end-users computer and assist them in troubleshoot.

277
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,550
So with this, we were able to in fact,

278
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:24,210
observe the data, I mean,

279
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,500
like how they are entering data,

280
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,753
what other mistakes that they are doing,

281
00:13:27,753 --> 00:13:29,629
as well as it helped us in troubleshooting

282
00:13:29,629 --> 00:13:31,480
when they&#39;re having issues.

283
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:36,093
So for this one also we had a separate SOPs that we created.

284
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:41,570
And the other thing that really helped us

285
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,570
in ensuring that data entry is timely and data entry users

286
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:52,570
are having minimal issues is that, the user support.

287
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,330
So for the, to provide the user support,

288
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,950
we had this three tier model.

289
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,664
So here what happens is we had this,

290
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:02,140
the initial communication method

291
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,700
which should happen using fax or hotline

292
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,080
or else we are using this instant messaging platforms

293
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,400
such as Wiver.

294
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,180
So there of course, they can reach over initial help desk

295
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,950
for for simple troubleshooting.

296
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:19,830
They did public health related issues,

297
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,730
or else very technological issues.

298
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,210
Like this will be attended at tier one.

299
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,000
And then in case they cannot settle there,

300
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,240
they&#39;ll be directed to the tier two

301
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,600
where we have a medical officer in public health,

302
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,670
as well as our ICT officer

303
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,480
will be attending to these issues.

304
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,780
And if they can&#39;t also solve them,

305
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,860
we have the consultant committee divisions

306
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,580
who are attending this technical matters

307
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,180
related to public health issues.

308
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,430
And the medical officer in health informatics

309
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,600
who is going to attend to the very technical

310
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,170
or technological issues.

311
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,530
So this way, it really helped us in ensuring

312
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:56,723
that all the issues the end-users are having are attended.

313
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,774
And when it comes to specific data quality measures

314
00:15:01,774 --> 00:15:02,607
that are already there in DHIS2,

315
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,553
we are mainly using most of these same MCH datasets,

316
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,860
their validation rules and compulsory data elements.

317
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,400
In addition, we are also using the data.

318
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,970
But we are in the process of incorporating min-max,

319
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,810
predictors, WHO Data Quality Tools, score cards,

320
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,870
and legends in this MCH instances.

321
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:27,820
But like why there is a delay is that,

322
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,950
we are trying to match all these tools that are there

323
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:34,030
into the existing the workflows

324
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:36,800
so that is why it is taking some time.

325
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,490
But this is our planning over the next a one year&#39;s time

326
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:44,080
to incorporate all this into the MCH data flow.

327
00:15:45,357 --> 00:15:47,995
And when it comes to review and feedback,

328
00:15:47,995 --> 00:15:51,900
we identify review and feedback as a major measure

329
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,570
in ensuring data quality.

330
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,620
So what we do is we have created dashboards

331
00:15:57,793 --> 00:16:00,030
and provided our end-users instructions

332
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:02,640
on how they should be following and adhering this dashboard.

333
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,490
So they are supposed to use this monitoring Dashboards

334
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,970
at facility level, district level,

335
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,010
provincial level and at national level.

336
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,130
So there have been clear instructions that we have provided

337
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,170
to the end-users on how to use these dashboards.

338
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:18,960
And in addition, we have the national level staff

339
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:23,190
who will be drilling down and conducting distributes

340
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,950
from time to time,

341
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:27,730
just make sure that whether there are any data quality

342
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:30,900
or any major data quality issues,

343
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,960
which are happening at a field level.

344
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,000
Because like, this is kind of like a secondary level

345
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,400
of monitoring for the district level staff,

346
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,250
which we are doing at national level.

347
00:16:40,230 --> 00:16:44,110
And to compliment this, we have regular reviews,

348
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:47,730
which is happening at the PHM is the field level,

349
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,240
public health midwife level,

350
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,740
or medical officer of health is kind of like

351
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:54,800
sub-district level, RBHS is the district level

352
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,660
and at the country level

353
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:58,200
in this frequencies that we have mentioned.

354
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,150
So how this happen is that,

355
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,570
now, what you are seeing here

356
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:03,870
is kind of like a district level review

357
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,120
where all the medical doctors who are in charge

358
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,600
of all these sub-districts will come to this place

359
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:14,940
along with few public health field level staff

360
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:17,430
and we are doing a comprehensive reading.

361
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:22,430
So these are, and one key thing is that,

362
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,100
for all these reviews,

363
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:26,660
we are using the DHIS2-based MCH system.

364
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,490
So we will be displaying the dashboards

365
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:31,390
and they have to comment on any of the data quality issues

366
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,890
that they expect panel from national level are asking.

367
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,730
Now these reviews did not stop

368
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:40,850
even during the COVID pandemic.

369
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,290
What actually happened was like,

370
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:45,260
it was another opportunity for us to further explore

371
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,570
what are the avenues which are available

372
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,210
to conduct these online.

373
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:53,700
So what we did was we organized the Zoom platform

374
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,520
that we have, and through the Zoom,

375
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,070
we were able to conduct this monthly and quarterly review

376
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,060
at district level using the remote technology.

377
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:06,240
So none of these review activities have stopped

378
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,140
even during the COVID-19 pandemic.

379
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,840
So what you&#39;re seeing here is the district level staff

380
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:14,490
who were joining through Zoom,

381
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,940
and then a certain level of staff

382
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:19,400
who are kind of volunteering whatever they are presenting.

383
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,060
Right, and these data that we have gathered

384
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,150
through our MCH system is produced as an annual report

385
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,520
from the Ministry of Health.

386
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,240
And we also have a MCH quantity report.

387
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,470
For all these reports,

388
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,260
the data is coming through the DHIS2-based system

389
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:38,720
and this is why like, once these reports are public

390
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,860
are made public, the institute and the ministry

391
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,540
has to hold the responsibility.

392
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,357
So that is why we are trying to ensure data quality

393
00:18:46,357 --> 00:18:47,470
in our DHIS2-based system,

394
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,400
because the reports are actually generated

395
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,700
through this system only.

396
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,890
Right, so these are some data quality measures

397
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,950
that we have insured in our MCH system.

398
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,250
So with this, I&#39;m going to move on to our second example,

399
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,090
which is the nutrition monitoring system.

400
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:11,090
Right, so this of course was the requirement

401
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,370
which is coming from the presidential secretariat level

402
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,280
of Sri Lanka, where the requirement was to identify children

403
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,990
who are having nutrition-related problems at field level,

404
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:25,840
and to obtain multi-sector support to address them

405
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,720
at field level.

406
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,470
But then the information had to be connected

407
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,670
and verified and transmitted

408
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,120
all the way up to the national level

409
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,530
and shared with the multi-sector state.

410
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:40,070
So the major functionality of this system

411
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,430
was to register the children with malnutrition

412
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,600
at field level.

413
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,940
And then they wanted to routinely monitor and track

414
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:50,140
the nutritional parameters such as height and weight

415
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,810
and household total risk factors.

416
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:55,750
So these are the routinely monitored components,

417
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,880
and then obtain household geo locations,

418
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,410
and also perform analytics (indistinct)

419
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:04,670
and the mobile users,

420
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:06,290
and to synchronize the data

421
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,710
which is collected at field level with the central server

422
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,120
and then share with the stakeholders.

423
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,910
So to achieve all these requirements,

424
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,010
we felt that it was the mobile technology

425
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:22,010
that we have to use and the traditional use of laptops

426
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:24,960
and computers to enter data will not really work

427
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,670
because the data has to be captured at individual level

428
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,050
at field level.

429
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,190
So this requirement of course,

430
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,750
came around four to five years back.

431
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,720
So at that time, the DHIS2 Android native mobile application

432
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,900
was not that mature

433
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,960
because nowadays it is having so many useful features.

434
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,120
But those days, there were some restrictions

435
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,420
to fulfill these functionalities

436
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:48,623
that were required by the program.

437
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,750
So what happened was this public health midwife

438
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,130
who&#39;s a field level health stuff,

439
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:57,310
a health worker will collect data at field level,

440
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,440
which is then synchronized

441
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:01,220
into the DHIS2-based central server,

442
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,960
and which could be accessed by their supervising officers

443
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,810
and all the staff at district and national level

444
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,450
using the web interface.

445
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:12,600
And once this data is sent by the midwife,

446
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,200
their immediate surprising officer

447
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,050
who is the medical office of health

448
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,180
or the applicant nursing sisters should validate that data,

449
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,860
and the data had to be returned back.

450
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,620
I mean, this validation once it happens only,

451
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,400
the data could be shared with all the stakeholders

452
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,210
who are involved at the process.

453
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:32,000
So to do this, of course,

454
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,890
what we did was to have this design,

455
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:39,630
this custom Android application due to the obvious reason

456
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:43,280
that some of these requirements were not be able to meet

457
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,720
by the DHIS2 Android application at the time.

458
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,630
Right, so let&#39;s quickly look at few data quality measures

459
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:54,280
that were in place in this Android mobile application

460
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,423
while capturing data.

461
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,750
So the first thing is like, there were some,

462
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,940
there were a few simple interfaces.

463
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:04,830
And now as you can see here,

464
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,917
these are few interfaces that we used

465
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:11,220
and simplifying interfaces itself

466
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,440
was identified as one major factor

467
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,717
to enhance the compliance of the end-users

468
00:22:17,717 --> 00:22:20,230
who are using the system, this is field and stuff,

469
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,210
and also enhance the data quality.

470
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,780
Because like, what we found out from our study was that,

471
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,600
when you have very complicated workflows

472
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,573
and very crowded interfaces,

473
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:33,440
it contributed adversely to the data quality

474
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,640
because the end-users can make lots of mistakes

475
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,270
because they just become confused

476
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:41,580
the complexity of the interfaces.

477
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,560
So using simple interfaces was one major practice

478
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,423
that we followed.

479
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:50,170
And secondly, because they were collecting

480
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:52,430
this height and weight values

481
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,750
of the children with malnutrition, what we did first,

482
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,500
we provided them a visual verification of the data

483
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,333
as they enter it.

484
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:04,160
So if you can focus in on this height and weight values

485
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,210
that are entered here,

486
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,110
you can see that color of this one is greenish, so that,

487
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,270
and this one is kind of like a yellowish amber color.

488
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:16,010
So what happens is now when someone starts typing height,

489
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,160
what will happen is like,

490
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,890
there will be some age verification based on the,

491
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,650
so we have the date of birth of the child

492
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,040
and the today date, and with this,

493
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,230
we&#39;ll be able to know which is the age.

494
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:29,740
And there&#39;ll be a kind of a verification

495
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:34,360
with the comparison of this WHO, there are standard ranges,

496
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,930
the reference ranges for different standard deviation values

497
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:40,730
for height and weight for that particular age.

498
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:43,330
So if the height or weight value is okay

499
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,640
it will be kind of a greenish color,

500
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,760
if it is a slightly bad it be amber,

501
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,810
and if it is really bad, it will be red color.

502
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:52,552
So that way, there&#39;ll be a visual verification that happens

503
00:23:52,552 --> 00:23:54,424
at the point of data entry.

504
00:23:54,424 --> 00:23:56,320
So that it will be about idea about,

505
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,740
if there is a major mistake done by the end-user

506
00:23:58,740 --> 00:23:59,923
at that point itself.

507
00:24:01,471 --> 00:24:06,340
And then of course, to further assist with data quality

508
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:08,470
as well as to support the interventions,

509
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,490
what we did was we provided some longitudinal charting.

510
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:15,730
So these are kind of like analytic outputs

511
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,270
that we integrated into system,

512
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,610
which contributes to enhancing data quality.

513
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:23,340
So here what happened is like, in the mobile app itself,

514
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:26,520
the end-user after entering the height and weight values

515
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,520
and verify by observing this height and weight charts

516
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,632
and see whether there is a, I mean,

517
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:37,980
kind of a significant abnormality in any of these values

518
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,670
that have been entered, right?

519
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:41,010
So there&#39;ll be a kind of a,

520
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:43,533
this kind of a like a dual verification of the data

521
00:24:43,533 --> 00:24:45,433
that was entered by the end-user.

522
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,640
And in addition, there were simple reports

523
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,440
and simple analytics which are available to the end-user

524
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,000
in the mobile application itself.

525
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,300
So it kind of provided them a very brief overview

526
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,850
about say like here, what you can see is like,

527
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:03,220
how many children have each of these nutrition problem

528
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,710
when they are under her care.

529
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:09,590
So that kind of analytical outputs are available

530
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,980
for the end-user.

531
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,510
Right, so once this data was captured that the field level,

532
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:17,970
the next, there was some validations that happened

533
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,550
at a facility level.

534
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,570
So for this one also,

535
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:23,500
there was a (indistinct) which was designed

536
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,800
mainly to cater the requirement of data approval

537
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,020
of tracker data, because this is tracker data, right?

538
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,820
So this is even though it&#39;s collected

539
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,870
by a custom Android application,

540
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,480
the data is sent to the DHIS2 system.

541
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,140
So that means, all this has to be in compliance

542
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,010
with the DHIS2 data model.

543
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:43,290
So this tracker data that is entered here will be verified

544
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,710
by their supervising officers.

545
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,580
So the supervising public health nursing sister

546
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,350
has to go through this data,

547
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:50,790
and they will be the ones who will be marking them

548
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:54,860
as completed after ensuring that they are adhering the,

549
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,780
I mean, at least these days are possible values

550
00:25:56,780 --> 00:26:01,470
that&#39;s what they can, I mean, at maximum level they can do.

551
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,050
So once this is done, there will be a data approval

552
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:06,407
which happens at the medical officer of health,

553
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:07,650
the MOH level.

554
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,260
And once the data approved only,

555
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,610
the data will be visualized

556
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,050
and shared with other stakeholders at provincial

557
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,293
and national level.

558
00:26:16,145 --> 00:26:20,300
And in addition, there were several data quality measures

559
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:23,250
that happened at various other levels,

560
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,600
which kind of assisted in this entire process,

561
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,130
because like the data had to be shared

562
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,550
with the multi-sector stakeholders.

563
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,783
This was a crucial step for validation of data

564
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:36,183
that is captured at the field level.

565
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:40,910
Right, so I think I have consumed almost 25 minutes,

566
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:43,950
so slightly over, so I will stop it at there.

567
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,677
And if there are any questions, I&#39;m willing to take it.

568
00:26:46,677 --> 00:26:47,993
Thank you so much.

569
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,099
- [Instructor] Great, now thank you so much Pamod.

570
00:26:52,099 --> 00:26:53,470
That was an outstanding presentation.

571
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:55,290
I really appreciate how you touched

572
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,790
on so many various elements of data quality

573
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,960
that people don&#39;t always think about.

574
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,500
We&#39;re always, you&#39;re exactly right,

575
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,400
we&#39;re always so concerned about checking the data

576
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,680
once it gets into the system and the different tools

577
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,340
that we have in DHIS2.

578
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,540
But you hit the nail on the head, so to speak,

579
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,760
when you talked about like form design,

580
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,520
standard operating procedures, training processes,

581
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,730
all of these things are absolutely critical to data quality.

582
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,890
And I&#39;m really, we tried to make that point yesterday,

583
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,280
and I&#39;m really glad you were able to drive it home today.

584
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,950
We did have one question from the community,

585
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,090
and again everyone, we are taking your questions

586
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,490
on the Slack channel just like we did yesterday.

587
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:32,680
So please if you have a question,

588
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,470
post that to the Slack channel.

589
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:36,383
There was one question,

590
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:41,990
they are asking if you faced any challenges

591
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:45,440
or you had to change anything during the implementation

592
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,350
of these various reporting forms and data quality checks.

593
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,420
So once you started actually implementing,

594
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,830
how did you, were there any changes that you had to make

595
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,893
in the process?

596
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,900
- [Pamod] Well, okay.

597
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,970
So as I mentioned one crucial fact was that,

598
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:02,690
we had to minimally disrupt the existing workflow.

599
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,160
So one major,

600
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,130
like this was not a very kind of a abrupt implementation.

601
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,690
So there was a, I mean, especially my other colleague

602
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,720
from Sri Lanka, was the one who was greatly involved

603
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,160
with this MCH system.

604
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,120
So there was like at least more than one year of planning

605
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,140
in assessing all the workflows and paper forms

606
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:23,490
to ensure that was, and there was a, I mean,

607
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,600
the other thing that I did not mention here

608
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,710
is the testing and piloting

609
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:30,350
that goes into the entire process

610
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,450
before you actually implement the system.

611
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:35,260
Because like, most of these data quality measures

612
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,750
should be captured at that point

613
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:38,730
if the system is not capturing data for, I mean,

614
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:42,270
like there are errors in data quality that you observed

615
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,670
during this piloting process.

616
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:47,150
Those have, I mean, you have to come back and reverse

617
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,900
whatever the workflow so the datasets,

618
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,400
the signs that you&#39;re following.

619
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,450
So there was a lot of planning and that&#39;s how, I mean,

620
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,283
after doing that only,

621
00:28:55,283 --> 00:28:57,640
we went for the first round of implementation.

622
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,190
So there were a lot of issues that we&#39;ve found

623
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:02,110
at that fields that were corrected.

624
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:04,300
And then what happened was,

625
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,760
during the initial round of change training

626
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,190
that we did all around the country,

627
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,190
there were some feedback that were coming

628
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,500
related to different issues with the datasets

629
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,780
and accessing the system workflows, things like that.

630
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,620
So during that time, we accommodated a lot of changes

631
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,510
that came from the end-users.

632
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:25,380
But after the first round of implementations,

633
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,590
we kind of like what we did was we received feedback

634
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,670
from the end-users,

635
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:34,060
but we did not go on changing the formats,

636
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,350
the day-to-day formats from time to time.

637
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,310
But (indistinct) was that,

638
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,700
if you need us to accommodate something

639
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,970
in the designs of the forms, so this will only be done

640
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:47,520
maybe at the start of next year.

641
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,940
So we kind of like, if they&#39;re not really critical,

642
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:52,490
we kind of collected all these things

643
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,480
and we discuss internally within our team.

644
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,909
And maybe at the start of next year,

645
00:29:57,909 --> 00:30:01,250
only we will accommodate them into the DHIS2-based forms.

646
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:03,450
But if they have a major changes that required

647
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,923
maybe collect, I mean,

648
00:30:04,923 --> 00:30:06,660
like to decide whether this data item

649
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,170
had to be collected or not,

650
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,747
that of course had to go to the complicated specialist

651
00:30:09,747 --> 00:30:12,920
and there has to be a decision that is required

652
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,970
which is of course totally out of the scope

653
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,070
of the DHIS2 implementation, so yes.

654
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:19,400
The other challenges but we were careful

655
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:23,073
not to entertain and include all the changes made

656
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:27,020
by the end-users, but we reviewed and incorporated them

657
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:30,840
on time to time basis, thank you.

658
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,850
- [Instructor] I think that&#39;s quite clear.

659
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,660
Thank you for that answer.

660
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,770
A couple of more questions, I know you&#39;re a busy man,

661
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:38,293
but if we can just keep you around for a few more minutes.

662
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,260
Question from Lisa Grout, in the application

663
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,050
that where you&#39;re tracking individual children,

664
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,743
do you do the validation child by child?

665
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,810
- [Pamod] Yeah, good question.

666
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:57,340
Yes, the thing is, it&#39;s a very difficult,

667
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,590
I mean like, this is one reason

668
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:00,470
like why we tried to incorporate

669
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,890
all these the color verification and things like that

670
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,100
at the point of data capture,

671
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,530
because otherwise it&#39;s going to be a very hectic task

672
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:11,050
for the supervising officer to go through all the reports.

673
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:14,970
So what we have, I mean like, we have made promises

674
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,130
in the system to verify child by child,

675
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,777
but when we are implementing what we have asked them

676
00:31:21,777 --> 00:31:23,110
it&#39;s like, because these are kind of like

677
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:25,450
when you try to have these systems implemented

678
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,040
in a couple of districts or provinces,

679
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:32,030
the infrastructure could be even technology, a mobile,

680
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:35,989
I mean, like the network, as well as human resources,

681
00:31:35,989 --> 00:31:38,070
they did greatly vary from district to district

682
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:40,250
or even from health facility to health facility.

683
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:42,090
So what we have instructed them with,

684
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:44,303
like, you always need to like,

685
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:47,510
the system has the potential,

686
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:49,670
but like it really depends on the capacity

687
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:51,395
that you have in your health facility.

688
00:31:51,395 --> 00:31:54,050
Like ensuring data quality.

689
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:57,580
So there is always a kind of a fine balance

690
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,930
between data quality and actually capturing data.

691
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:03,310
Because they, if you have minimal capacity

692
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:08,310
and you priority number one is ensuring data quality,

693
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,290
then unknown data will come out from the facility.

694
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,390
So it&#39;s kind of like we have given them the choice.

695
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:18,010
So this is what the system has, this is the best practice,

696
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:22,260
but it&#39;s totally up to you to decide on what you should do,

697
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,610
but we have given them some incest

698
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:25,830
really how to capture

699
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,610
if there are any major data quality issues.

700
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:31,740
Like we have asked them to observe

701
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,220
the data entry practices of end-users.

702
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:36,900
And if they identify from the preliminary study

703
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,250
that there are a couple of end-users

704
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,300
who really do these mistakes over and over again,

705
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,170
then you can either focus on them

706
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,790
when you are validating the data or is to provide them

707
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:48,510
kind of refresher training and guidance

708
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,590
to ensure that they are not doing those mistakes.

709
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,440
So there are the simple answers,

710
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:57,060
like we have not kind of strictly enforce these rules,

711
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:02,060
and we have make it so taxable

712
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:06,590
so that the end-users, the health facilities can decide

713
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:09,480
which is the best option for them.

714
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,600
- [Instructor] Right, okay, thank you very much for that.

715
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,100
The questions are coming in quite quickly now.

716
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,470
It seems like people are really intrigued

717
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,230
by your presentation.

718
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,510
Just two more questions for you

719
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,823
before we need to take a break and move on.

720
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,380
We have one question.

721
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:26,910
I&#39;ll just go ahead and ask both of them now.

722
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,030
We have one question is, how long did it take

723
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:31,680
to implement these various data quality checks?

724
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,160
And then the other question is,

725
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,050
what happens if suspicious data is found

726
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,820
in the review process, how do you go back

727
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:42,930
and make the change and how to keep track of the changes

728
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:43,780
that you&#39;ve made?

729
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:48,150
- [Pamod] Yeah, so I will take the MCH instance

730
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:49,597
for this example (indistinct).

731
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:55,801
So like, the MCH instance was initially set up in year 2017

732
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,230
and now we have asked three years of implementations.

733
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:02,840
So data quality, ensuring data quality

734
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,460
was not the number one priority during 2017.

735
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:11,230
So in 2017, it was mainly about addressing user use

736
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,730
in accessing the system, entering data,

737
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:15,700
and to ensure the completeness

738
00:34:15,699 --> 00:34:17,840
like even those are data quality measures,

739
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:22,070
but like, we didn&#39;t go into this final data related issues

740
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,330
in the first year.

741
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,400
But then from your 2018, 2019,

742
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,780
the easiest we focused mostly on the data,

743
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:30,720
I mean, like things specifically,

744
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,930
we put a lot of emphasis on during the reviews,

745
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:36,450
because these reviews used to be happening

746
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:41,450
based on the paper data that was previously before 2017.

747
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,940
So then there was some transformation required

748
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,960
from 2018 onwards to use the system

749
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,910
for these review meetings, so it took some time into that.

750
00:34:51,909 --> 00:34:55,610
So it was like, so what I would like to say is like,

751
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:58,550
if you see how it&#39;s our plan for future,

752
00:34:58,550 --> 00:35:00,060
so we have more plans

753
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:02,360
like compared to what we have done so far.

754
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,260
So, it&#39;s a work in progress.

755
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,620
So we have achieved some level as of now,

756
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,170
but we have lot to do.

757
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,760
So we can say like we have ensured data quality

758
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,950
this last three years, we have done,

759
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,320
we have taken some major steps,

760
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,240
but there&#39;s lot more to do.

761
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,660
So it&#39;s really about like what you&#39;re trying to achieve.

762
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,123
And sorry, what was the second question?

763
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,310
- [Instructor] What happens if you do find suspicious data

764
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:28,470
in the review, how is it changed

765
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,390
and how do you keep track of the changes?

766
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,920
- [Pamod] Yeah, the thing is like, now that of course,

767
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,590
like what happens is like,

768
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:37,700
they try to understand what is the issue with data

769
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,533
during this review.

770
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:41,890
So for example, now I mentioned about this distributes

771
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:45,420
that our staff is conducting at national level.

772
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,910
So during the distributes,

773
00:35:46,910 --> 00:35:50,810
if they identify some data quality issues

774
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,610
before the reviews, they will contact the health facility

775
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,660
and advise them.

776
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:58,663
And if for some reason, if the same mistake is happening

777
00:35:58,663 --> 00:35:59,630
over and over again,

778
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,530
they really try to talk to the health manager

779
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,567
or the public health doctor

780
00:36:02,567 --> 00:36:05,120
and identify why it is happening and try to like,

781
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,950
if they identify the issue

782
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,210
that this may be happening recurrently,

783
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:11,940
so then there may be some training gaps,

784
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,670
which if we identify the, even like, what we try to do

785
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,750
is if we feel that in a particular district,

786
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,700
that there is the same mistake that is happening

787
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,780
over and over again,

788
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:26,490
we try to organize the refresher data analysis training,

789
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:30,500
there we also talk about data quality during that process.

790
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:34,150
And then the other thing is sometimes like, I mean,

791
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,398
to ensure the timeliness,

792
00:36:35,398 --> 00:36:39,950
we locked the data after a particular given period of time.

793
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,970
So then we have to put what we do

794
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:45,320
is we will put lock exceptions and after accepting that

795
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,090
it&#39;s a mistake and when they have like the end-user

796
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:51,310
at the facility developed,

797
00:36:51,310 --> 00:36:52,970
they accept that it&#39;s a mistake

798
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,790
which has been communicated to national level.

799
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:56,730
Then normally we will put a doc exceptions

800
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,280
and unlock the data for it to be corrected.

801
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,223
So those kinds of measures are what we do

802
00:37:02,223 --> 00:37:05,530
when I know there are some data quality issues.

803
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,690
- [Instructor] Okay, that&#39;s very clear.

804
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:09,270
And again, thank you so much Pamod

805
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,940
for the wonderful presentation.

806
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,990
There were many quite a few questions

807
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,290
that I don&#39;t think we have time to get to, we.
