(smooth jazz)

1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,410
- [Norah] This is the session on the Data Quality Review.

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:13,193
And your report is part of the Data Quality Online Academy.

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,749
So there are two aspects that we are going to talk about

4
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:18,582
in this session.

5
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:22,280
The first one is the annual report

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,080
using the WHO DQ Tool,

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,910
and then secondly the process

8
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:29,200
of actually reviewing your data

9
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,260
and making the appropriate corrections.

10
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,001
So if we start back at the WHO DQ Tool,

11
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,663
your first question is, have you installed it?

12
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:43,523
Has it been customized or have you left it as the default?

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,770
Again, brings up the question,

14
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,070
who&#39;s responsible for this customization.

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,040
Only the HMIS Team or the M&amp;E Team,

16
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,660
the program managers.

17
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,333
Who all is involved?

18
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:00,790
If we take the purpose of this report,

19
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,130
who needs it and why do they need it?

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:06,903
And out of this report,

21
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:12,120
the actions taken or are any actions going to be taken

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,340
that result in demonstrable changes?

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:20,340
So the bottom line is does this report change anything

24
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,840
or does it just become a nice report in a glossy folder

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,403
stored in a glass cabinet?

26
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,800
The second aspect of this data quality review

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,490
is to look at the data and to fix it.

28
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,950
And it&#39;s about checking for outliers and obvious data errors

29
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,800
and then correcting them.

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,650
Checking for missing months of data

31
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,150
and then filling them in.

32
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:47,670
Specifically if you know a facility has worked,

33
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:50,723
but no pieces of paper have arrived.

34
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,570
On the tool bar for the WHO DQ Tool,

35
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,410
there&#39;s something that says Annual Report.

36
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,500
You click that open and the first option you have is data

37
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,950
and you can select a group.

38
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,550
It could be Core, it could be Immunization,

39
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,020
it could be Maternal Health,

40
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:11,280
for the period.

41
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,710
You then select the year

42
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:15,740
that you want to run the annual report for

43
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:18,200
and how many years before that

44
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,960
do you want as reference so that there is some background.

45
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,430
And then you select the organization unit.

46
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,310
This could be the whole country,

47
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:31,310
sub-level, sub-national, or sub-national times two.

48
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,883
The choice again is always yours.

49
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,950
You will then get a report that is completed

50
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:44,420
and it will show up under in the WHO DQ Tool.

51
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:47,210
You then have the option of printing the report

52
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,873
and you will be able to save it as a PDF.

53
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,710
So this report, the one I ran was nine pages.

54
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,970
Looks at completeness, timeliness, facility reporting

55
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,540
completeness of indicator data, and all of guidance

56
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,000
and indicators showing you what&#39;s helping

57
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,203
with completeness, with timeliness of the data.

58
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,190
So this is what this report looks like.

59
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,100
So the questions are,

60
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,853
so here&#39;s this report.

61
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,833
Is this report helpful?

62
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,023
If it&#39;s helpful, for who is it helpful?

63
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,083
What guidance can you gain from this report?

64
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:40,290
And is this report a guarantee that the data

65
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,943
is correct, complete, consistent, and timely?

66
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,794
So all four of things that are whole

67
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:52,100
are looked at with part of the development

68
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,240
of an annual report on data quality

69
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,763
using the DQ Tool.

70
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,610
The second section of this presentation

71
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:04,410
looks at the data quality review and data cleaning.

72
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,883
And the use case we&#39;re going to talk about is South Sudan.

73
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:14,710
Fortunately, or unfortunately it was them using DHIS 1.4,

74
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,400
not DHIS 2.

75
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:21,400
We are still looking for use cases with DHIS 2.

76
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,440
And it was done for the years 2012, 2013, 2014 data

77
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:30,270
and here is a map of South Sudan,

78
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,043
and a flag if you don&#39;t recollect it.

79
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,000
So the first question is why do we bother to clean the data?

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,020
And the problem is that poor quality data

81
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,690
makes the data unusable.

82
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:50,690
You can&#39;t use it for accurately estimating indicators,

83
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,550
coverage of performance, coverage of service delivery,

84
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,840
and that means that all that effort that you went into

85
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,780
to create and to collect and to capture

86
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,430
and to clean the data from all the facilities,

87
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,830
there is no return.

88
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:11,973
So the data is collected, but it&#39;s not usable.

89
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,750
We also know that if there are

90
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,453
a few obvious data entry errors,

91
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,410
people can take this as a sign

92
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:23,320
that all the data is untrustworthy.

93
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,263
And that we know is not true.

94
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:30,580
Experience has shown that on the whole,

95
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,580
generally HMIS data is generally reliable.

96
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,149
It&#39;s not perfect, it will never be perfect,

97
00:05:39,149 --> 00:05:42,853
but it should be good enough so that it can be used.

98
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,803
If we go about correcting any of the obvious errors

99
00:05:47,803 --> 00:05:52,803
that we see, the data then becomes usable and acceptable.

100
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,240
And usable data, and acceptable data

101
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:02,240
is much better than unusable data which has no value.

102
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,053
Just stores up space in the computer and costs money.

103
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:11,040
What we do know is that in spite of everybody saying,

104
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,910
well we do validation checks

105
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,540
and we have quarterly data reviews,

106
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,000
data errors do creep in

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,890
and they frequently remain undetected and uncorrected

108
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,853
and stay there to haunt you for years.

109
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,340
And as we said, South Sudan was using DHIS 1.4

110
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,060
at the time of the data cleaning process.

111
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,030
So some background to what happened in South Sudan.

112
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:42,720
First of all, because a minimum indicator based dataset

113
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,690
implemented in 2011, so it was based on indicators

114
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:51,000
and from the indicators we defined the data elements,

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,600
we put them into data collection tools

116
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,043
and it was two pages with one page for EPI.

117
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,430
And there was a decision made in 2013

118
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:07,430
to provide a report for 2012, the Annual HMIS Report

119
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,380
because we now had a year of data.

120
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,920
However, on reviewing this data,

121
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,135
it quickly became apparent that the data

122
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:20,650
was not good enough to be used.

123
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:24,010
We could not use it for the annual report.

124
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,820
And so the decision was made

125
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,500
that we would go back and we would clean the data

126
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,380
so that it would become usable.

127
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,080
And so this was then done at state level, some national

128
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,774
and we also did combine some states for convenience

129
00:07:42,774 --> 00:07:45,700
just so that in terms of time

130
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,913
and in terms of distance and travel.

131
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,170
Present at these data cleanup workshops

132
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:56,100
was the State M&amp;E Officer, and the County M&amp;E Officer

133
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,050
for each county and they were responsible

134
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,020
for correcting the data.

135
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,810
Because it was the county, they knew

136
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:07,120
what was going on in their area.

137
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,690
They could easily contact the facility people

138
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,180
responsible and ask questions.

139
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:17,450
They did all of that work about fixing the data.

140
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:22,220
It took approximately four to five days per group of States

141
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:25,270
and it was a really labor intensive process

142
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:28,210
with everybody working from early in the morning

143
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,450
to late in the afternoon in the heat and dust

144
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:33,963
of South Sudan to get this work done.

145
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,280
So, we first made some crucial decisions.

146
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,640
The first one was that we were going to

147
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,340
concentrate on the headcount.

148
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:47,010
Knowing how many people access the health services

149
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,990
is crucial to understanding how much money you have,

150
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,270
how many resources you need.

151
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:53,816
So headcount.

152
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:55,110
Then we looked at children

153
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,620
with diarrhea, pneumonia, and malaria.

154
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,540
Because we&#39;re also defining a vulnerable population.

155
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,360
We then looked at maternal health in terms of

156
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,090
anti-natal visits, deliveries, live births, IPTP

157
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,160
and the things relating to maternal health

158
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,290
because we also see that those were the crucial things

159
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,363
to have correct.

160
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,910
We ran validation rules, absolute and statisticals

161
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:26,150
were run and any violations triggered were noted.

162
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:28,713
The same process that we use in DHIS2.

163
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,700
Extreme outliers were identified

164
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,360
and corrected using tools in 1.4,

165
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440
which include interpolation and regression analysis.

166
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,370
Interpolation is making an educated guess

167
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,630
based on data before and data after.

168
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:50,480
And regression analysis, we&#39;re not going into

169
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,403
a mathematical discussion this afternoon on this.

170
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,140
The second process was we would concentrate

171
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,493
on replacing the missing months of data.

172
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,707
In other words, we will know that a facility worked,

173
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:08,880
but for some unknown reason,

174
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,170
the piece of paper never arrived.

175
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,740
And there are many explanations and reasons for that.

176
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:19,740
Insecurity, unable to travel, no stop, whatever

177
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,020
but we know the facility worked

178
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,210
so we professed missing data.

179
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,010
And when we looked at validation rules

180
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:29,460
with compulsory pairing.

181
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,540
In other words, if you have one you must have the other.

182
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,520
An example would be diarrhea treated

183
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,440
must have diarrhea reported.

184
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,613
We fixed those up.

185
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,680
We look for extreme outliers and corrected those

186
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,380
at facility level.

187
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:50,380
Specifically if a value materially altered the indicator.

188
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:55,960
If it skewed the indicator, it became important enough

189
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,220
to correct the data.

190
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:02,010
And in this process, we looked both at raw data

191
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,610
and at indicators.

192
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,370
Because frequently on raw data,

193
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:08,300
you may not see that something is wrong.

194
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,607
But when you look at it as an indicator,

195
00:11:11,607 --> 00:11:13,810
that that data element is part of an indicator,

196
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:16,383
it becomes apparent that something is not right.

197
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:20,230
So some of the actions

198
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,440
and some of the things that we did.

199
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,613
We developed a decision tree for data outliers.

200
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,550
If it was out of range and then there was the services,

201
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:32,940
first of all look did the data elements hang together?

202
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,550
Did they make sense when you looked at them?

203
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:39,400
Then, using regression we recalculated

204
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,190
a value that made no sense.

205
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,800
If the data elements did not hang together,

206
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,000
in other words they made no sense,

207
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,170
we would recalculate the key data elements.

208
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,640
The most important ones and provide a comment.

209
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,003
Again, using data from previous months and months after.

210
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,070
And if we had data, there was no services

211
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:03,460
that were provided by the health facility,

212
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,650
we would just delete it.

213
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:07,160
So this is just some of the ways we looked

214
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,603
at trying to fix outlier data.

215
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,870
Trying to fix missing data.

216
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,570
We looked at was the facility

217
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,690
actually providing any services?

218
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,293
And if it wasn&#39;t, then we closed it.

219
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:30,130
If we realized that the facility did not work for one month

220
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,200
or maybe even two months due to security,

221
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,673
due to no staffing, whatever,

222
00:12:37,876 --> 00:12:40,130
but if the services were not provided,

223
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,500
we wrote a zero and we gave a comment.

224
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,423
So that was no longer missing data.

225
00:12:47,939 --> 00:12:52,727
The facility did not function so it&#39;s not missing data.

226
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,550
And if we said that services were provided

227
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,330
by the health facility, and the data was missing,

228
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:03,000
we corrected it using interpolation

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,193
and regression analysis to fill in the gaps.

230
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:11,800
So why was it possible to do this in South Sudan?

231
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,030
Well, there were a few reasons.

232
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:17,963
First of all, it was a very, very small dataset.

233
00:13:18,915 --> 00:13:20,143
It was only two pages.

234
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:26,381
The local staff of M&amp;E offices were eager to be responsible

235
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,520
and fix their own data.

236
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,870
They wanted good, clean data.

237
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:36,350
And they took great pride in having data with no violations.

238
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:39,280
And there was a lot of hands on support and supervision

239
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,693
to guide people through this process.

240
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,530
Well what were some of the results?

241
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:48,520
First of all, we had cleaned data for three years

242
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,613
resulting in an annual report for each year.

243
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:56,890
How many of your countries are doing an annual report

244
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,333
each year for your HMIS data?

245
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,140
Because we had data for three years,

246
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:06,973
we were able to measure service delivery over time.

247
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,620
Were counties and states getting better,

248
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,183
were they staying the same?

249
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,937
And one of the most crucial aspects for us,

250
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:18,750
the development of the capacity and the knowledge

251
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:22,663
of the M&amp;E staff regarding both HMIS and DHIS.

252
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,680
And as we all know, when you start out in a country

253
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,030
one of the biggest issues is an updated facility list

254
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:34,063
so a lot of work went into fixing a facility list.

255
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:40,196
So in conclusion, has all the missing data,

256
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:41,760
where you know a facility worked

257
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,500
but there&#39;s no report been added in?

258
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,273
Have you fixed all your outliers?

259
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:51,197
Have all your validation rules been fixed or explained?

260
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,250
And then the question is

261
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:56,810
whether WHO takes responsibility for this?

262
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,033
Is it important to do this in your situation?

263
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:05,330
And so we are left with two exercises.

264
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,170
The first one is about the WHO Annual Report.

265
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:11,870
So you either use your own country&#39;s DHIS2 instance

266
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,640
or the demo one.

267
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,000
Run the annual report for a selected OU unit

268
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,120
and Data Elemental Indicator Group.

269
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,780
Print it, which will allow you to download in PDF format.

270
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,850
Then review it and discuss it.

271
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,810
How can you use this report?

272
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:32,050
We know that there are quite a few of you

273
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,560
working in the same country

274
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:37,030
and I think that this would be a very nice exercise for you

275
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,173
as a group to have a look.

276
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,430
And then in terms of the data review and corrections,

277
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:47,820
either your own DHIS2 or the demo instance.

278
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,820
Using the WHO DQ Tool, find the missing data and outliers.

279
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:56,650
What needs to happen to replace these missing values

280
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:59,133
or correct the obvious data outliers?

281
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:03,330
And here&#39;s the difficult question,

282
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:07,030
how will you decide what the new value should be?

283
00:16:08,246 --> 00:16:09,514
Thank you.

284
00:16:09,514 --> 00:16:12,014
(smooth jazz)
