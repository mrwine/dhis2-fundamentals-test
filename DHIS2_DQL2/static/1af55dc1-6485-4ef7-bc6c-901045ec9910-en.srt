0
00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:05,130
- Let&#39;s push on and get to the actual configuration.

1
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:07,880
Okay, so it hasn&#39;t been configured.

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,860
We recognize that, and now

3
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:16,023
let&#39;s launch the administration, the configuration page.

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,782
This instance is really very efficiently designed

5
00:00:20,782 --> 00:00:24,690
and our internet connectivity is good.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,690
So we are instantly taken to this first page

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:34,740
on configuration, but what what you will often find

8
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:39,740
is that you&#39;ll get a message, even as a super user,

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,240
you&#39;ll get a message that says you do not have authority

10
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,452
to change the configuration.

11
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:52,452
And the issue may be just internet connectivity,

12
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:58,630
that it&#39;s not able to communicate with the app

13
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,443
because of internet connectivity issues.

14
00:01:01,443 --> 00:01:03,820
And you may have to wait awhile

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,732
before the message disappears

16
00:01:06,732 --> 00:01:09,703
that says you don&#39;t have access rights.

17
00:01:11,468 --> 00:01:15,850
To be able to do the configuration

18
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,580
you have to have the level of authority

19
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,440
of someone who can define indicators

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,210
and the user roles which have that level of authority

21
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:30,933
are the ones which are able to do this configuration.

22
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,240
Now, what is it that we are configuring here?

23
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,300
You can use the analysis function

24
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:40,280
even without doing any configuration.

25
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,830
So anyone with access to the data quality tool

26
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:48,470
can go through the steps of selecting one data element

27
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:51,590
or one indicator and looking for outliers,

28
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:53,090
doing comparisons.

29
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,480
But what we are configuring here is really

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,430
the dashboard of the data quality tool.

31
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:04,307
These are the numerators which will appear on the dashboard.

32
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:09,307
We&#39;re also configuring at the same time, the annual report.

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,070
And we won&#39;t spend time in this internal training

34
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,610
discussing the annual report,

35
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:19,781
but those are the two things that are being configured

36
00:02:19,781 --> 00:02:23,360
with this page here.

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,040
Actually, there&#39;s a series of six,

38
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,510
and what we&#39;d like to do is take you through

39
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:34,758
the first four of these, in this internal training,

40
00:02:34,758 --> 00:02:38,437
starting of course, with the numerators

41
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:42,210
and you see the columns here, groups,

42
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,480
what is a group, a reference numerator?

43
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,985
What does this mean? Core and data element indicator.

44
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:53,610
The groups, if you scroll down,

45
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:58,043
you see the pre-assigned groups,

46
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:03,780
general service statistics like hospital admissions,

47
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,420
outpatient visits, HIV.

48
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,300
These are the rest of the groups are basically programs.

49
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,610
You can actually add a group.

50
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,730
Now, what&#39;s the point of a group?

51
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,730
The groups determine what you see in the dropdown menu

52
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:26,590
and we have to configure at least one numerator

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,080
before we&#39;ll see any group.

54
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,550
So let me show you,

55
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:35,317
let&#39;s go ahead and configure DPT 3,

56
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:39,760
and then we&#39;ll see the functions of a group.

57
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,220
So I click on DPT 3.

58
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:47,220
This is the name, that WHO is recommending

59
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:53,140
that this be a core, notice core is checked here,

60
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,400
they&#39;re recommending that you configure this

61
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,560
as a core indicator or data element.

62
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,610
And if I recall for the play instance,

63
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,213
DPT 3 is a data element.

64
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:11,340
It&#39;s in the data element group of immunization,

65
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,283
or is it EPI up here?

66
00:04:16,829 --> 00:04:18,270
Let&#39;s see, yeah.

67
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:22,960
Immunization data element group, a comment,

68
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,363
notice in this dropdown list,

69
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,943
there&#39;s nothing comparable to all data elements.

70
00:04:31,951 --> 00:04:36,220
When you configure a pivot table or a chart,

71
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:38,760
you&#39;re used to having a dropdown menu

72
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,070
that allows you to select from all data elements.

73
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,230
Well, that&#39;s not possible with the data quality tool,

74
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,600
this version of the data quality tool.

75
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,925
So, if the data element you want

76
00:04:51,925 --> 00:04:55,960
is not in a data element group,

77
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,470
or if the indicator that you want to select

78
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,710
is not an indicator group, then you simply can&#39;t select it.

79
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,210
And what you have to do is exit the tool and assign

80
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:10,850
that data element to a data element group,

81
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,350
or assign the indicator to a data element group.

82
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:17,826
It&#39;s one of the clunky features of the tool

83
00:05:17,826 --> 00:05:20,250
that you simply have to get used to,

84
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,250
but in this case, the DPT 3 is there.

85
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,840
And what I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m finding the exact name

86
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,700
in the play instance of the data element

87
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,623
that is equivalent to this WHO recommended

88
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,150
reference numerator of DPT 3.

89
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,930
So the comparable one I found on the list is Penta three.

90
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:51,410
And then you have to specify what data set is in there.

91
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:54,721
And this one is a bit curious,

92
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:59,721
you see the detailed data elements and it almost

93
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:04,920
doesn&#39;t matter a great deal which one you select,

94
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,670
this appears in the annual report.

95
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:11,670
It doesn&#39;t appear anywhere else on the data quality tool,

96
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:14,330
but the annual report makes use of this.

97
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,330
And the rule that I suggest is to take the data element

98
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,440
that probably has the largest value, in this case,

99
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,123
it is fixed immunization under one,

100
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:30,090
only after you have filled in all of these,

101
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:34,720
let&#39;s say that we hadn&#39;t filled this in, we left it blank.

102
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,410
Notice the save button is grayed out.

103
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:42,480
So it insists that you fill in all of these

104
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,040
and sometimes if internet connectivity is poor,

105
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,840
one of these, just simply won&#39;t allow you,

106
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,390
the app won&#39;t allow you to fill it in

107
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:56,550
and then you just have to wait a bit,

108
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,610
pause until you&#39;re allowed to fill in

109
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,920
every single field of this screen

110
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,083
and then you can save.

111
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,460
So I&#39;ve saved.

112
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,370
Okay, and now notice, okay,

113
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,900
we&#39;ve got, it&#39;s in the immunization group.

114
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,170
This is the WHO recommended name,

115
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,930
the name doesn&#39;t really matter a great deal,

116
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,633
core is checked here and I&#39;ll show you what core means.

117
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:30,670
And this is the name of that, what we have mapped the WHO

118
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,230
reference numerator to a specific data element

119
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:39,670
in the play instance and it&#39;s from the child health dataset.

120
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,130
Now, let me show you the function of the group.

121
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,280
If we go to the dashboard

122
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:50,420
and the settings window, we now have,

123
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,720
finally, the dashboard has something on it.

124
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,410
It&#39;s got the child health completeness

125
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,070
on the completeness page

126
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:02,850
and under data, if we look at the dropdown menu under data,

127
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,833
we have two groups,

128
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:09,820
DPT 3 was assigned to the core group

129
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:13,130
but it&#39;s also in the immunization group.

130
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,785
So these groups are

131
00:08:15,785 --> 00:08:20,785
the selections that appear in the data window,

132
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,210
the data you&#39;re not selecting, unlike the app,

133
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:28,410
the pivot table app, or data visualizer,

134
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,870
you&#39;re not selecting a data element

135
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,960
or indicator or a dataset,

136
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:36,700
you&#39;re selecting between these groups.

137
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,700
And as we go on, we&#39;ll see how using this data window,

138
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:47,150
it allows you to do a data quality review

139
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,060
that is specific for one program

140
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:56,060
and a program might have a larger number of indicators

141
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:59,060
that are specific to immunization, okay?

142
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:04,060
So I&#39;m going to go back to the numerator configuration page

143
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,008
and show you one more

144
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:10,208
and then we&#39;re going to,

145
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:13,983
we&#39;re going to see if a volunteer can,

146
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:20,791
or perhaps we&#39;ll do that tomorrow at the same time

147
00:09:21,675 --> 00:09:24,950
and get a volunteer to practice this

148
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,020
so that I can show you some more features of configuration.

149
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,197
I&#39;m going to do one more, DPT one,

150
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,410
actually, I&#39;m going to show you another limitation

151
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,750
or aspect of the tool that&#39;s less user-friendly,

152
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,150
let&#39;s say that we don&#39;t want this to be a core,

153
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,760
see these check marks are in the column for core

154
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,070
and this means it is one of the data elements

155
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:59,010
that you see on the dashboard if you set data to core.

156
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,750
So let&#39;s say that we&#39;ve changed our mind,

157
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:06,020
we don&#39;t want to have DPT 3 amongst the core indicators,

158
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,230
just as an immunization indicator,

159
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:12,950
so we click on edit and you can easily enough

160
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,630
de-select core but notice what has happened

161
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:20,110
to all of these other fields of the window,

162
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,140
they&#39;ve disappeared.

163
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:25,281
So the app has no memory.

164
00:10:25,281 --> 00:10:30,281
If you go in to reconfigure DPT 3,

165
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,739
you&#39;ve got to start from scratch

166
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:38,460
and go through this process once again,

167
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,630
repeat everything, which is a bit tedious,

168
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,670
but that&#39;s for now what you have to do,

169
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,530
you have to reset everything before you can reconfigure it.

170
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,093
So now we have changed DPT 3,

171
00:10:56,093 --> 00:11:01,080
so that it is no longer a core indicator.

172
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:05,320
And in fact, let&#39;s see what we find if we,

173
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:09,970
yeah see it&#39;s blank, there&#39;s no indicator in core,

174
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,480
but if we change this to immunization,

175
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:18,480
then the indicator DPT 3 is in the immunization group.

176
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,690
So the dashboard shows results for DPT 3.
