<h3>What’s In This Module?</h3>

<p class= "text">Now that you’ve got a good understanding of data quality, as well as how some of the tools work in DHIS2, how do you set up your DHIS2 instance to facilitate good data quality?</p>
<p class= "text">In this Module, Bob Pond will walk you through how to install and configure the WHO Data Quality Tool (WHO DQ Tool). You’ll learn how to configure the different types of numerators and parameters you’ll need to set up to start analysing data quality in the WHO Data Quality Tool. You’ll also look at some of the key considerations you’ll need to make when configuring the app in relation to common challenges.</p>
