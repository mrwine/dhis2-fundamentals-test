00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,630
- [Narrator] So I realize that this has been a summary

1
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:05,250
of a lot of different concepts.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,230
Often, we would spend much more time

3
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,911
going through this in more detail, you know,

4
00:00:10,911 --> 00:00:15,911
particularly concrete examples of collapsing categories

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,870
or maintaining categories over time,

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:23,830
or you know, linking indicators, making sure we can make,

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:26,150
do something with various desegregations,

8
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:28,050
all the items that we&#39;ve talked about.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:32,210
You know, we&#39;ve been kind of pushing it

10
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,810
into the smaller session, but you know,

11
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,090
what I really wanna emphasize is that being able

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,960
to identify these issues is enough to get started.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,960
If we&#39;re able to have solutions for a lot of these problems

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,090
is that we can influence more than others,

15
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,820
then that&#39;s also something we can kind of support.

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,040
There are some areas of course,

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,660
that are more challenging to support directly

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,610
in a country, because even though it&#39;s something we,

19
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,340
as Groups have capacity to support,

20
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,740
it might be more challenging

21
00:01:03,982 --> 00:01:04,815
to share this capacity with others.

22
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:08,230
And I think that that&#39;s a key, critical challenge.

23
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:09,930
You know, if we&#39;re going to have

24
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,660
good systems that have good data quality,

25
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:17,870
then we need to have, you know, the ability to share

26
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,220
a lot of these processes with our partners.

27
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:23,780
And that is still something we&#39;re struggling with.

28
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,580
So some of the concepts that we&#39;ve talked about,

29
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:28,010
we went through poor form design, you know,

30
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,270
just looking at some forums

31
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,770
that had in particular desegregations in the wrong place

32
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:34,070
and had lots of duplicates,

33
00:01:34,070 --> 00:01:35,510
either between different programs

34
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,260
or even within a different program,

35
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,490
or even on the same form itself

36
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,723
when you added up various data elements and categorize them.

37
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,620
So the whole idea here was just to kind of start

38
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,960
to think about these and how you would identify

39
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,390
some of these, right.

40
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:54,610
It&#39;s not necessarily something you can fix quickly.

41
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,990
You can give recommendations of course,

42
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:00,410
but you know, this takes time to fix often,

43
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:03,860
and it also can influence your design to some extent,

44
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,000
if you are able to kind of set up your data elements

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,150
in a way where totals, for example,

46
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,400
would give you the correct total

47
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,170
and not give you subsets and, you know,

48
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,940
misinformation about the totals

49
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,050
that you&#39;re actually adding up.

50
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,640
We then talked about a number of customization items

51
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,450
that we could influence.

52
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:25,700
And there were a number of actually that we could actually

53
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,960
have some greater influence on,

54
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,230
due to processes that we could implement,

55
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,390
mitigation measures we could take,

56
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:34,160
things that we could review manually.

57
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,900
You know, this included various things

58
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:40,440
like collapsing categories, sorry, category options,

59
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,050
via category option groups in group sets.

60
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:45,880
This included things like putting in procedures

61
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,910
for creating our metadata,

62
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,420
making sure that we&#39;re not doing things

63
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,540
on a production instance directly.

64
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,055
Implementing things

65
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:58,280
that would kind of support their local workflow.

66
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,340
And that is something we can have a bit more influence on.

67
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,810
But then we also talked about maintenance challenges

68
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:06,110
that were more difficult to handle directly

69
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,600
within an implementation,

70
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,146
and maybe not so much more difficult to handle

71
00:03:10,146 --> 00:03:12,920
from an expert&#39;s perspective,

72
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,310
but actually sharing this knowledge with others

73
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,559
and having others interact with this,

74
00:03:17,559 --> 00:03:20,590
decentralizing these roles and tasks.

75
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:22,390
This can often be a bit more challenging

76
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:25,370
because the way DHIS2 is built,

77
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,730
some of these things are impractical to do

78
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,360
using the user interface.

79
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,560
So then how do we teach people, you know,

80
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,884
using other tools?

81
00:03:32,884 --> 00:03:35,420
Is that a whole other discussion,

82
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,330
and what is the effect this has then

83
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,470
if we&#39;re not able to do this

84
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:42,950
on data quality and data use, if we&#39;re not able

85
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:45,930
to maintain these systems over time that, you know,

86
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,480
eventually lead to all this problems

87
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,840
with usability essentially,

88
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,940
and being able to find the information

89
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,203
or even just maintain things over time.

90
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,540
We also discussed some tools and processes

91
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,410
to support assessments of DHIS2 to design,

92
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,670
and it might&#39;ve come a surprise to some of you,

93
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,120
but a lot of this is manually done,

94
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,450
as you would have seen as I presented

95
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,360
a lot of these challenges, you know,

96
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,050
it&#39;s really a measure of looking at things in more detail

97
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,370
and going through, either through the interface

98
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,960
or kind of diving through the database

99
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,100
and looking through things in more detail,

100
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,910
but there are some tools and processes

101
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,120
that can help you with this, you know,

102
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,630
but just identifying these things to begin with.

103
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,990
You know, I think it is quite beneficial,

104
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,720
even if you&#39;re not able to fix them directly,

105
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,580
you know, find ways to identify them,

106
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,420
to share them with others and to kind of have them

107
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,260
on the potential roadmap of fixes

108
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,400
to implement in your systems.

109
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,110
So you can improve the data quality

110
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:46,840
and data use of that system essentially.

111
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,510
But in terms of some tools and processes

112
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,270
we discussed outside of manual work of reviewing things,

113
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,130
we discussed the data integrity check,

114
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,600
which really looks at metadata, not data.

115
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,570
And we also discussed some extended SQL scripts,

116
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,150
but give you a broad summary

117
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:03,830
of some of the issues that you might see,

118
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,250
particularly with things like blank pieces of metadata

119
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,030
that are just kind of there in your system,

120
00:05:09,030 --> 00:05:12,160
and really might not be serving any purpose anymore.

121
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,736
Things like data sets, data elements,

122
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:16,170
things like maps that might be shared incorrectly,

123
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,350
or you know, just giving you totals, et cetera.

124
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:21,100
So there are some examples there,

125
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,110
the SQL file is there and you can run those

126
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:26,670
if you so choose, but just letting you know

127
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,830
that that option is there to help you perform

128
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,606
a bit more of a detailed assessment of the metadata

129
00:05:32,606 --> 00:05:34,730
that you can compare and contrast,

130
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,280
and kind of give a high-level overview to people

131
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,240
on what some of the issues actually are,

132
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,400
without going through a detailed

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,800
manual review potentially.

134
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,870
You know, that could be the start.

135
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,070
And then you start going through things in more detail,

136
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,700
finding out the actual source

137
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,780
of these problems, and then you know,

138
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,460
finding out a strategy to deal with them one by one.

139
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:56,260
So, this wasn&#39;t meant to provide answers necessarily

140
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,740
to all of these different problems,

141
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:01,060
but it was meant to kind of provide a wide overview

142
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,610
of what some of these challenges might be.

143
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,150
And it might not seem at first

144
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,940
when you see some of these problems,

145
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,090
that they might affect data quality, but I think

146
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,320
you know, the longer these problems persist,

147
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,440
the more and more challenges you will have

148
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,600
with getting the correct data

149
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,500
out of your system and you know,

150
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,670
if you can&#39;t access the data,

151
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,690
if you don&#39;t even know where to find things in your system,

152
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,170
because it&#39;s so poorly designed, then you know,

153
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,410
this really has a great impact on the quality

154
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:29,120
of the information and the outputs

155
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,550
that are being produced by said system.

156
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,530
So just keep selling these things in mind

157
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:35,450
when you&#39;re dealing with your own implementations

158
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:38,240
and, you know, because of the nature of this

159
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,390
and the way how we went through things

160
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,330
in a lot of quick detail,

161
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:45,080
it was more informational versus, you know,

162
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,530
having hands on examples for everyone to work through

163
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,410
and really kind of think through these problems

164
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:53,560
on their own, please feel free to reach out

165
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,560
and ask us any questions about this.

166
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,410
We&#39;re quite happy to discuss this in more detail

167
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:02,300
and walk through some of these processes a lot more,

168
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,350
if that is something that you would like.
