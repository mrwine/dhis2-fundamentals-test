00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,120
- [Man] So mapping reference numerators.

1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,663
It is not always easy to identify the best data element.

2
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:11,263
Why not?

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,470
In principle, you just find the data element group

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,700
and then in the group you select the indicator

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,350
or the data elements rather.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,330
So in principle, it&#39;s as easy as falling out of bed

7
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,430
in the morning.

8
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:29,763
But let&#39;s go on.

9
00:00:31,067 --> 00:00:33,010
Okay. Why?

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,010
Challenge number one is this is not so unusual.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:43,020
This is a national instance that has 8,000 data elements.

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,990
So finding the right data element

13
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,083
is the proverbial needle in the haystack.

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,553
So let me go to the next point.

15
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,300
You may find yourself in searching,

16
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:02,240
and this is searching in the Pivot Table app,

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,350
for

18
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,180
just the right one.

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,940
And we use the search function, all data elements.

20
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:15,680
In the Pivot Table app you can do all data elements.

21
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,770
So you could, and I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve done this yourself,

22
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:22,680
search for all of the data elements

23
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,763
that are related to DPT.

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,390
This isn&#39;t possible, again, within the Data Quality tool.

25
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,330
So you have to do some homework in advance

26
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:40,330
and use some other app like the Pivot Table app

27
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,233
to find just the right data element.

28
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,663
Okay. Of course,

29
00:01:55,610 --> 00:02:00,450
one way of dealing with this proliferation of data elements

30
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,990
is to form groups or either a data element group

31
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,313
or an indicator group.

32
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,750
This is even an essential step

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,840
for configuration of the Data Quality tool,

34
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,020
because if your data element has not already been

35
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,100
assigned to a group, as I said before,

36
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,180
you&#39;re not going to be able to grab hold of it

37
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,800
when configuring the Data Quality tool dashboard.

38
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,130
So your data element needs to be in a group

39
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,260
and ideally your group should have

40
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,260
just a limited number of data elements in it.

41
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,450
I comment here about data element groups.

42
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,793
I have started,

43
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,700
when working and supporting configuration,

44
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:56,880
I&#39;ve started to form a

45
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,940
special group called Data Quality

46
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:04,350
and I put into that data element group

47
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,550
all of the numerators

48
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:11,550
that I think the ministry is interested in reviewing.

49
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,380
Hopefully that list is not too large

50
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,800
and this is where we advocate

51
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,540
for encouraging the ministry

52
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:29,520
to identify a small number of data elements

53
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,720
and indicators that they want to look at.

54
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:36,790
If you&#39;ve got 8,000 data elements

55
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,160
and 5,000 indicators,

56
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,620
there is absolutely no way

57
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,620
that you can keep informed about quality issues

58
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,090
with thousands of data elements and indicators.

59
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:54,490
So an essential step, absolutely essential

60
00:03:54,490 --> 00:03:58,750
is that the ministry makes some decision about

61
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,750
a group of, let&#39;s say, at most 50 indicators

62
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,750
that they want to be tracking

63
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,420
the programs.

64
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:10,030
Now

65
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,030
the tuberculosis program, if they have data and VHIS too,

66
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,800
they may say, &quot;Well sorry, we want to look at more than 50.&quot;

67
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:23,230
So maybe each program in addition would have its own list

68
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:26,340
of 30 that it wants to look at.

69
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,130
So this is an essential governance step

70
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,280
that the ministry has to go through in deciding

71
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,760
what are these core indicators, to use the word core

72
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,683
in a somewhat different since,

73
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,160
and I don&#39;t know, Nick, do you have any other words

74
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,292
of advice on how we address this bottleneck

75
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:53,720
and people selecting the indicator lists

76
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,143
that are most important?

77
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,050
- [Nick] No, I think it&#39;s just,

78
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,083
some of this comes down to the database design obviously.

79
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,080
We&#39;ll talk about that more potentially later on.

80
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,215
But I think you&#39;ve covered the pertinent points.

81
00:05:11,215 --> 00:05:14,330
It&#39;s just basically can be quite difficult to manage

82
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:16,780
because the tool itself has its limitations

83
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,610
in how you map things and then of course the database

84
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,840
on top of this, whichever database that you&#39;re using,

85
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,500
will have its own limitations and how things are organized

86
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,560
and they&#39;re often not optimal.

87
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,770
- [Man] Yeah. Yeah.

88
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,610
So indeed,

89
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,020
we&#39;re touching on design issues.

90
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,470
Are the groups optimally configured

91
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,740
to support easy use

92
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:43,830
and that&#39;s a bigger issue.

93
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,940
It also comes in with analysis.

94
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,820
The users who wants to

95
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:55,200
configure a chart or a table,

96
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,980
they need to be able to easily find

97
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,573
just the right data element.

98
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,670
I don&#39;t know other than to suggest that they

99
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,550
convene a meeting where they say, &quot;Okay, we know it&#39;s

100
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:13,690
very hard to select our favorite 50, but

101
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,300
we&#39;re going to lock the door

102
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,057
and you&#39;re not allowed to leave the room.&quot;

103
00:06:19,633 --> 00:06:21,980
Who&#39;s going to be in the room?

104
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,533
The HMIS unit,

105
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,250
some representatives of programs,

106
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,870
maybe some representatives of districts.

107
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,880
Because if you don&#39;t focus your Data Quality desk review

108
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,960
you&#39;re not going to hit on the most important issues.

109
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,843
Okay. So to move along.

110
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,960
Numerator only indicator.

111
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,530
So here&#39;s this example.

112
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,840
Here we are actually in the maintenance app,

113
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,053
this screenshot.

114
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:57,310
And here&#39;s a country, in fact, this was

115
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,260
the instance we used on Monday,

116
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:02,730
here&#39;s the country where third doses of DPT-3

117
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,063
that are delivered from a fixed site, a static site,

118
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,563
that&#39;s a separate data element from,

119
00:07:14,614 --> 00:07:17,930
I&#39;ve even defined this wrong I realize,

120
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:19,710
this should be a three here.

121
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,060
So I made a mistake

122
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,393
in configuring DPT-3 doses given.

123
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:32,480
In fact, that&#39;s the next slide.

124
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:37,128
But imagine this is DPT-3 from outreach.

125
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:41,480
So what you have to do is a step in configuring the tool

126
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,730
is to exit the tool,

127
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:45,630
go to the maintenance app,

128
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:48,110
go to the indicators function,

129
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,653
and define this new numerator only.

130
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:56,750
We call it a numerator only indicator because

131
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:00,200
the denominator for it is going to be one.

132
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:05,200
And it&#39;s simply to add together the fixed in the outreach.

133
00:08:10,932 --> 00:08:13,760
That&#39;s the point of challenge number three.

134
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,453
And when you grab a hold of an existing indicator,

135
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:24,060
especially with tuberculosis, not unfrequently,

136
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,383
you come across indicators like this.

137
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,210
It requires a very painstaking process

138
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,070
to define this properly.

139
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,110
I&#39;m sure you&#39;re much more familiar with this than me,

140
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:41,793
having configured a lot of indicators.

141
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,470
The administrator has to sit down

142
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,460
with the tuberculosis people who understand

143
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,570
this great variety of TB indicators,

144
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:57,950
and with extreme attention to detail,

145
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:01,820
make sure that the indicator

146
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,980
is properly defined because in the end,

147
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:10,010
if what you&#39;re reviewing with the tool

148
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,060
is an indicator that isn&#39;t even properly defined,

149
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,150
then you&#39;ve wasted your time.

150
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:18,630
You want to review the quality

151
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:20,823
of a properly defined indicator.

152
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,040
Full stop.

153
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,480
Okay.

154
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,623
Another challenge of the process.

155
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,660
If you want to look at the quality of HIV data,

156
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,810
well, often the instance doesn&#39;t have the HIV data

157
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,720
or the TB data.

158
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,800
Sometimes the instance won&#39;t have hospital data

159
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,510
on inpatient care,

160
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:43,260
on human resources.

161
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,510
Very few instances have the staffing data there

162
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:50,030
or the logistics information.

163
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:54,220
So what do you do if you want to look for extreme outliers

164
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,570
in these other datasets?

165
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,920
Well, you&#39;ve got a couple of choices.

166
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,763
I like the DHIS2 Data Quality tool.

167
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:10,690
One solution, that&#39;s the second bullet,

168
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,440
is to take the HIV data and import it

169
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,673
into the DHIS2.

170
00:10:21,938 --> 00:10:25,480
Take the aggregate data and bring it into DHIS2

171
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,710
and then you can use the Data Quality tool.

172
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,310
I remember one country that really

173
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,800
had its own data management system.

174
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,773
And we had an academy there,

175
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,750
the December before last, I think it was,

176
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,750
and the director of the HMIS unit was so impressed

177
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,720
at the power of the Data Quality tool

178
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,310
that she wanted to know how to code the tool

179
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:57,920
into their own data management software.

180
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,660
And I said, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you simply import the data

181
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,060
into DHIS2?&quot;

182
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,683
I don&#39;t know whether she followed up on that advice or not.

183
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,500
Frequently when you demonstrate the tool

184
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:16,008
to high-level officials, they&#39;ll love it.

185
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,047
They&#39;ll say, &quot;This is what we need.&quot;

186
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,054
Okay. And then the other solution.

187
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:25,550
WHO has an Excel tool

188
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,430
that allows you to look for outliers

189
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:33,520
and look for all of these aspects of consistency

190
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,780
but it doesn&#39;t have anywhere near the flexibility.

191
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,990
You can&#39;t drill down.

192
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,990
But the point is that in some cases for these other datasets

193
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:49,830
that are missing, if you have district aggregate data

194
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,680
by month

195
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,730
or by quarter in the case of TB data,

196
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:58,210
then you can, if you format it properly,

197
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,450
you can load it into the Excel tool

198
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,593
and then you can look for these aspects of inconsistency.

199
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,760
I am not keeping an eye on the clock here.

200
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,803
How many minutes do we have?

201
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,160
- [Nick] Yeah. About 10 minutes.

202
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,993
- [Man] Okay.

203
00:12:19,248 --> 00:12:20,098
Another challenge

204
00:12:25,917 --> 00:12:27,750
you may find

205
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:31,410
and I found this in several national instances,

206
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:34,170
that there&#39;s more than one data element

207
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,370
that appears to be

208
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,240
for the same thing.

209
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,490
So here&#39;s an actual example where,

210
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:48,700
in the Pivot Table app, I&#39;ve used the search function,

211
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,290
the search window to look for DPT-3

212
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,690
and I found two different data elements

213
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:56,723
that appear to be for pinto one doses.

214
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,543
And if you&#39;re not careful, when you configure the app,

215
00:13:02,524 --> 00:13:07,333
you may map it to a data element that&#39;s empty.

216
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:13,210
In this case, outside of the tool,

217
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,160
what you need to do is

218
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,280
a bit of investigation

219
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,793
and that&#39;s what the next slide shows.

220
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:27,310
Here, what I&#39;ve done is I&#39;ve used the data visualizer

221
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,110
to look at the data for these two different

222
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:35,300
data elements for pinto one doses, DPT-1 doses,

223
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:38,530
and I added in here the targets

224
00:13:39,486 --> 00:13:40,319
just to know

225
00:13:41,425 --> 00:13:42,810
just for comparison.

226
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,370
And what I found when I did this

227
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,730
is that there&#39;s the green data element,

228
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,713
which looks very similar to the blue one,

229
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,803
is empty.

230
00:13:53,803 --> 00:13:56,293
There there&#39;s hardly any data for it.

231
00:13:57,924 --> 00:13:59,890
And then you&#39;ve got to write down this

232
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:03,230
and carefully make sure when you do the configuration

233
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:07,713
that you grab hold of that right data, correct data element.

234
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:15,330
Another challenge here

235
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:18,980
is when you are

236
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,270
selecting indicators or data elements

237
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:26,380
that you want to include on the dashboard,

238
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,630
ideally, you would be using data elements

239
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,403
which had a high level of completeness.

240
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,360
If you put on the dashboard

241
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,160
an indicator or a data element from a dataset

242
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,210
where only half of facilities are reporting,

243
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:52,830
or even higher, if it&#39;s 70% of facilities,

244
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,860
you will almost always find

245
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,750
the data are highly inconsistent.

246
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,510
So in a way you don&#39;t even need to bother to use

247
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:04,120
the Data Quality tool

248
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,070
if the completeness is below 70% or 80%

249
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:12,130
because you&#39;re going to find so much inconsistency in there.

250
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:15,510
And the real fundamental problem has to do

251
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:18,100
with the reporting rate with the completeness.

252
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,703
But in this case,

253
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,730
we want to look at anti-natal care

254
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:26,130
and yet the data set

255
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,910
that is for anti-natal care coverage

256
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:33,760
has quite a low reporting rate.

257
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,290
So it&#39;s the best data element we can use.

258
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:38,690
It&#39;s imperfect.

259
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,240
The reporting rate is low.

260
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,483
But all the same,

261
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:45,680
we&#39;ll go ahead and we&#39;ll include it

262
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:49,210
on the dashboard

263
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:54,170
because there&#39;s no alternative data elements

264
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:57,210
available in the DHIS and this is the data

265
00:15:57,210 --> 00:16:01,690
which the ministry is using to track

266
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,910
anti-natal care

267
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:08,410
even though we know it&#39;s going to generate

268
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,013
inconsistent results because of the low reporting rate.

269
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:17,500
Challenge seven, I&#39;m almost ready to wrap up

270
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,830
before I teach you a bit of Sinhala.

271
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,603
I don&#39;t know if (indistinct) is back on.

272
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:34,640
What we find with imported data,

273
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:38,620
if you import the HIV data into

274
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,610
the instance,

275
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:44,100
keep in mind that when you import data

276
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,870
you don&#39;t import the completeness metadata.

277
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,830
You usually don&#39;t.

278
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,290
And so here&#39;s the data on ART

279
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,560
care and treatment,

280
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,470
that dataset.

281
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:02,520
And you look at the tool

282
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,100
and it&#39;s blank.

283
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,370
It&#39;s got no completeness

284
00:17:07,871 --> 00:17:08,704
on the page,

285
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:11,220
the completeness page of the dashboard.

286
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:15,490
And that&#39;s true of every region.

287
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,070
And the simple

288
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,320
reason that there&#39;s no completeness is that

289
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,500
you&#39;ve got to work with the completeness metadata

290
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,113
in order for DHIS to track this.

291
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:32,040
And that&#39;s not a simple thing.

292
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,040
I think we need to develop guidance on how to generate

293
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,600
completeness metadata for imported data sets.

294
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:44,470
I got started with it, but I&#39;m not a backend type of person.

295
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,670
So I think someone who&#39;s

296
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:52,060
got greater skills in using the backend

297
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,820
ought to come up with guidance

298
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,830
or an app or I don&#39;t know what,

299
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:00,760
on how to help to get the completeness metadata

300
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:05,520
in there so that we can track this most fundamental

301
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:08,360
metric of Data Quality.

302
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,887
So there we are. Thank you.
