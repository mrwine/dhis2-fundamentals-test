00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:02,640
(light music)

1
00:00:04,429 --> 00:00:07,373
- [Bob] On the login page, there&#39;s the username.

2
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,340
And we&#39;re in, before we proceed

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,180
to discussing the WHO Data Quality Tool,

4
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,200
I want to pause for a couple of minutes

5
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:35,010
to draw your attention to a special dashboard

6
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,920
that has been designed on this instance of DHIS 2.

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,230
This is the data quality dashboard

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,230
and we encourage you to also configure on your own DHIS 2

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,840
something that looks at data quality in the same way.

10
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,980
In fact, the standard applications of DHIS 2

11
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:04,150
are well-designed to look at

12
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:07,660
such aspects of data quality as the completeness.

13
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:10,390
Here you see for multiple datasets,

14
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:13,250
the trend over the last 12 months

15
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:15,033
and the reporting rates.

16
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,770
Or a table that disaggregates

17
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,273
the reporting rates by district.

18
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,990
This is a chart that is looking at

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:27,710
that second dimension of data quality

20
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:31,333
which is internal consistency in time.

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:37,190
Is the value of in this case ANC first visits,

22
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:40,160
is it consistent in time?

23
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,160
And we see at national level a couple of examples

24
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:49,940
where the monthly value was not consistent in time.

25
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:54,790
So a chart like this showing the month-to-month trend

26
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:59,790
can allow you to identify the very largest outliers,

27
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:04,320
suspicious values, values that are very different

28
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,920
from what was reported in other months.

29
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,510
We will see how the WHO Data Quality Tool

30
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:16,510
is even more sensitive at picking up these outlier values.

31
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,900
Also on the dashboard,

32
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:22,500
there&#39;s a table that presents for you

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,900
the very largest extreme outlier values

34
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,003
reported for various data elements.

35
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,770
And there&#39;s a chart that is looking

36
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:39,660
at the consistency between related elements.

37
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,170
Remember this was one of the metrics,

38
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:45,740
one of the things to assess with the Data Quality Review.

39
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:50,570
In this case, comparing the first doses of Penta

40
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,570
reported by a district to the third doses of Penta.

41
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,270
And these two districts have a negative dropout rate,

42
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,950
So that is suspicious

43
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,050
because they have reported higher numbers

44
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,253
of third doses of Penta than first doses.

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:14,070
And just wrapping up our quick view

46
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,210
of this standard data quality dashboard,

47
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:19,910
here&#39;s a chart which is comparing

48
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:24,880
estimates of coverage from two different sources.

49
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,970
The blue bars show you

50
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:30,410
the routine estimate of coverage

51
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,880
based upon the data

52
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,670
reported monthly by each health facility,

53
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,480
and that routine estimate of coverage

54
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,370
is compared to the estimate

55
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,653
from a recent demographic health survey.

56
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,880
So this is the assessment

57
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,210
of that third dimension of data quality that we mentioned.

58
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,620
This is external consistency of the data.

59
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,680
And we see that for one region,

60
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,050
there is not very good external consistency

61
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:07,040
between the survey and the routine estimate.

62
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,860
And finally, the fourth dimension

63
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,360
of the Data Quality Review framework

64
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,140
looks at the consistency of the denominator values.

65
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,560
And in this case,

66
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,560
we see that there is not consistent growth from year to year

67
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:29,530
in the estimated S value of the population

68
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,230
under one year of age,

69
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,030
that denominator used to calculate

70
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:38,000
coverage with most immunization data.

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,000
We see that there was a drop between 2015 and 2016,

72
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:48,130
whereas with other years there was what we would like to see

73
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,350
which is a steady annual change,

74
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:55,800
a steady annual growth in this denominator.

75
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,290
So we encourage you to use

76
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:03,290
the standard applications of DHIS 2 to look at data quality.

77
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,220
What we&#39;re going to do now is switch over

78
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:14,220
to using the WHO Data Quality Tool application.

79
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,350
If you&#39;ve got a lot of applications to choose from,

80
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,650
one way to rapidly find the WHO Data Quality Tool

81
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:29,590
is to in the search apps line type in WHO

82
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,000
and then you&#39;ll find the only application

83
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,780
that has WHO in its name.

84
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,803
We&#39;d launch that application.

85
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:42,070
And right away, we&#39;re taken to this page

86
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,330
which as you see from the highlighting up at the top,

87
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,990
this is the dashboard of the data quality.

88
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,890
The WHO Data Quality Tool.

89
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,450
Later, we will learn about some of the other functions

90
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:59,680
of the WHO Data Quality Tool

91
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,933
and specifically the analysis function.

92
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:09,270
But for now, we&#39;re going to focus on the dashboard

93
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,860
and specifically on this first page.

94
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:15,060
You see that the dashboard

95
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:18,660
or the WHO Data Quality Tool has four pages.

96
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:22,740
We will present on each of these four pages.

97
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:27,050
For now, we&#39;re going to focus on the completeness page,

98
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,773
the dashboard of the WHO Data Quality tool.

99
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:37,567
The completeness dashboard shows results

100
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:41,690
for the completeness of several different datasets.

101
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,020
If we scroll down here,

102
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,660
we see ANC dataset completeness,

103
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:51,660
HMIS dataset, immunization, malaria, maternity.

104
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,130
And for each of these datasets,

105
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,813
there are two charts.

106
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:05,790
The charts on the left is showing you

107
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:07,930
the trend in the reporting rate

108
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:11,493
and the completeness over a 12-month period.

109
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,490
You see here on the axis which 12 months,

110
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:21,490
from September 2019 to August of 2020.

111
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,560
Why is it going up to August of 2020?

112
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Well, over here is something called the settings icon.

113
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
And if we click on that,

114
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,730
a special window opens that allows us

115
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:41,363
to set how this dashboard is configured.

116
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:46,680
We&#39;ll say something later about setting data,

117
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,380
but let&#39;s change how the period is set.

118
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,320
Now it is set to August 2020

119
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,550
and notice the chart on the left

120
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:02,550
is showing completeness over 12 months up to August 2020.

121
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,110
The chart on the right is showing

122
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:08,630
the completeness for a single month.

123
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:12,250
Which month? August of 2020.

124
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,903
Notice what happens if we change the period.

125
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,110
We&#39;ve selected July as the period

126
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:22,710
and now the chart on the left

127
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:26,900
is showing also a trend over 12 months,

128
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,900
but it is the 12 months which end in July of 2020.

129
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:34,410
And the chart on the right

130
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:38,320
shows us the completeness for a single month,

131
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,353
the month of July 2020.

132
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:50,030
The histograms, the bars in the chart on the right

133
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,610
are disaggregated by region.

134
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,483
It shows completeness for each of the four regions.

135
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:05,310
If we look at the settings for organization unit,

136
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:10,133
notice it is set here to desegregate by region.

137
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,490
Let&#39;s see if we can change that.

138
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,770
Let&#39;s change it to desegregation by district.

139
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:23,040
Aha, now we see that the charts on the right

140
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,680
are showing completeness for the ANC dataset,

141
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,250
disaggregated to show completeness

142
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:34,253
for each of the districts in the country.

143
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,270
So we see how we can configure the dashboard.

144
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,223
We can change the configuration by changing the period.

145
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:49,200
We can change disaggregation.

146
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,730
We could also instead of looking

147
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:55,370
at all of the data nationwide,

148
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:58,620
we could decide to look at only the data

149
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,913
for one specific region.

150
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,800
Here we have completeness

151
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,800
only for the districts within region A.

152
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,890
Or even if we click on the plus sign,

153
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,740
then we see a dropdown menu

154
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,560
showing all of the districts in region A

155
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,143
and we could select one,

156
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:25,240
and automatically desegregation is set

157
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,310
to one level below the district

158
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,063
so it&#39;s set to facility.

159
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,340
Okay, we will go back.

160
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:40,213
Leave this on the month of July.

161
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:45,460
Set the national as the boundary.

162
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,960
District as the disaggregation.

163
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,960
And let&#39;s see what happens when we change data from Core

164
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,120
and Core, notice Core shows you results

165
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,863
for multiple different programs.

166
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:08,790
Let&#39;s change Data to one specific program, Immunization.

167
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,390
Now we are looking at completeness

168
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:18,163
only for the Immunization dataset.

169
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,530
So we see how by changing the settings,

170
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:27,530
we can use the dashboard

171
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:32,530
to look at a different set of programs.

172
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,030
In this case, Core means multiple programs.

173
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,820
We can look at the completeness for a different period.

174
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:44,450
Even we can change the year

175
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,663
and look at the completeness for December of 2019.

176
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,550
And we can change

177
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,790
organization unit to disaggregate differently

178
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:59,790
or look at a different boundary of data.

179
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:07,550
We will continue in the next presentation

180
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,410
to review consistency time

181
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:12,040
and that&#39;s when we will see

182
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:16,080
how useful it is to change the data

183
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,095
to a specific program like immunization.

184
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:20,928
(light music)

185
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:21,761
Thank you.
