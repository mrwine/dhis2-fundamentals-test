00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:00,903
- [Instructor] All right.

1
00:00:00,903 --> 00:00:03,920
So today our first session before our break

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:07,970
is going over DHIS2 Data Quality Validation Rules

3
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,313
and Notifications.

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,250
Again, this is gonna be fairly technical.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:15,460
I&#39;m going to have to go quite quickly through this.

6
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:20,080
So if you fall behind, please ask a question on Slack.

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,500
List of video will be posted later today, hopefully,

8
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,130
maybe tomorrow.

9
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:27,760
And so you are certainly invited to rewatch it.

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,460
You can slow it down if you&#39;d like

11
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:34,000
and make sure that you&#39;re capturing everything

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,960
if this is something that you wanna implement

13
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,310
in your country or project.

14
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,410
What are the objectives of the presentation?

15
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,060
Well, essentially we wanna understand

16
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,600
the logic behind validation rules.

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,330
We also wanna give you a quick overview

18
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,080
on how to build validation rules.

19
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,080
This may be a recap for some of you.

20
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,500
I know many countries already have

21
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,758
a lot of validation rules.

22
00:00:54,758 --> 00:00:57,180
I think we&#39;re gonna expand your appreciation

23
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,003
of what validation rules could actually be used for.

24
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,517
But the key message is that we need

25
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,810
to have data quality coming to the user.

26
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,700
So right now all of you are using your email

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,890
more than you&#39;re using DHIS2.

28
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,870
I certainly do.

29
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:21,473
And I&#39;m one of the DHIS2 product managers.

30
00:01:21,473 --> 00:01:24,880
I&#39;m looking at my email every day, almost all day.

31
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:29,170
And we need to start to build in processes

32
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:33,232
where data quality and even just alerts for data,

33
00:01:33,232 --> 00:01:35,250
start to come to people&#39;s emails.

34
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,540
That&#39;s where they&#39;re spending their time.

35
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,640
They&#39;re not spending their time so much on DHS2 dashboards.

36
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,340
And there&#39;s just two little jokes here.

37
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,120
You can look at these yourself,

38
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,790
but the whole point being is we need to start sending data

39
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,850
to where people are spending their time.

40
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:52,090
Certainly we need to start sending notifications

41
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,420
for any kind of major data quality problems

42
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,580
to where people will actually see them quickly,

43
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,680
which is probably going to be their email.

44
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,515
Again, send data quality issues to the user.

45
00:02:06,515 --> 00:02:07,960
Over the last couple of days,

46
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,070
we&#39;ve been looking at the various data quality apps,

47
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:13,420
the WHO data quality app in particular.

48
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:16,570
And we appreciate that there&#39;s a lot of functionality there

49
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,623
if you go into the application.

50
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,700
But we also have to appreciate the fact that many people

51
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:25,573
are not going to go into that application very often.

52
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:31,340
Many people are going to not feel compelled

53
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:35,130
to dig through the data, to find the data quality issues.

54
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,480
This is where we assist Administrators,

55
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,150
as DHS2 managers, as health information system managers

56
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,500
have to be proactive.

57
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,400
We have to set up the system to be able

58
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,290
to push data quality alerts and notifications

59
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,400
to where people again are spending their time,

60
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,820
which is probably their email.

61
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:53,620
You can even set it up to send it via SMS.

62
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,310
We know that data use is low.

63
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,630
And we talked about on Monday,

64
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,990
how one of the driving reasons for this

65
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,810
is because data trust is low.

66
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:04,370
There&#39;s actually a whole lot of research out there

67
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,750
that makes this point very, very clear.

68
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,640
And that people just don&#39;t trust the data

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,503
because they&#39;re not able to see the data quality issues.

70
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,920
And what are some things that we can do?

71
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,240
Well, again, data quality issues

72
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,610
are not a failure of the system.

73
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,920
They&#39;re a feature of the system.

74
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,700
Any kind of large project that is using DHS2,

75
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,940
will have data quality issues.

76
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,150
The failure is not being able to do something about it.

77
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,690
The failure is to keep people unable to see

78
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,083
the data quality issue.

79
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:40,630
And so how do we do that again,

80
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,660
probably for the fifth time already this morning?

81
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,910
We need to start sending the data quality alerts

82
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:47,650
and notifications directly to the folks.

83
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,130
DHIS2 is smart enough to actually send people,

84
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,730
alerts and notifications directly

85
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,890
to where they&#39;re spending their time,

86
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:56,433
email, SMS, even WhatsApp.

87
00:03:56,433 --> 00:03:59,590
And the point of this presentation today

88
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:03,350
is to start to train you on how to configure DHIS2,

89
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:06,573
to actually do this, and also introduce some best practices.

90
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,273
The final point here to make is that the alerts

91
00:04:11,273 --> 00:04:13,730
and notifications that you actually send to people,

92
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,690
need to be based upon some standard operating procedures.

93
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:19,840
We saw in the case that (indistinct) presented in Sri Lanka,

94
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,080
they have very clearly defined,

95
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,584
standard operating procedures.

96
00:04:22,584 --> 00:04:26,940
On Monday, Andrew from Rwanda is going to present

97
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,950
on the Rwandan standard operating procedures.

98
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,920
Many countries have very good

99
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,490
defined standard operating procedures.

100
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,720
Many countries also have very poorly defined

101
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,810
or don&#39;t even have data quality,

102
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:38,450
standard operating procedures.

103
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,810
You need to have the standard operating procedures in place.

104
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,420
And the notifications and alerts

105
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,080
that you start to send from the system,

106
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,923
need to be in agreement or in alignment

107
00:04:45,923 --> 00:04:49,370
with your existing standard operating procedures.

108
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,630
You don&#39;t need to have people guess what they need to do

109
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,540
when they receive an alert.

110
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,180
The alert should tell them what they need to do.

111
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,060
And if they are confused,

112
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:00,020
then they can refer back

113
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,240
to their standard operating procedures

114
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,190
that should make everything very clear.

115
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,650
So how do we start to send the alerts?

116
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, the best way to do it is through validation rules.

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,960
So quick intro to validation rules,

118
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:19,300
validation rules are a way to assess the data

119
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,380
that has been entered in DHIS2.

120
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:22,770
And it&#39;s very based sense.

121
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,070
They&#39;re based on predefined rules.

122
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,707
You define the rules in the system,

123
00:05:28,707 --> 00:05:31,610
and we&#39;re gonna show you how to do that, just a minute.

124
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,480
Validation rules though do not fully allow you

125
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,480
to check whether the data that is reported

126
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,633
is complete or accurate.

127
00:05:43,221 --> 00:05:44,350
It&#39;s just going to tell you,

128
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,323
does it fit this rule that you have defined?

129
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:51,590
So the data could still be wrong and not trigger

130
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,290
a validation rule, just to make that point very clear.

131
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,730
But we&#39;re asked quite often to do various HMI assessments.

132
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:04,690
And one of the first things that we usually look at

133
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:07,000
is do the countries, or do the projects

134
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,803
have clearly defined validation rules?

135
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,930
And are they being used routinely?

136
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,420
And if they are, and they do then typically what that means

137
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,890
is the country is taking data quality very seriously.

138
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,780
If they&#39;re doing that,

139
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,300
then we can hopefully make a little bit of an assumption

140
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,240
that there is some data use

141
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,430
or data use is actually happening in the country.

142
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,870
If countries or projects

143
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,760
do not have clearly defined validation rules,

144
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,800
if they&#39;re not using them routinely

145
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,590
or they just don&#39;t have them at all.

146
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:41,910
It&#39;s fairly safe to say

147
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:46,910
that they are not taking data quality various seriously,

148
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,160
and that they do not probably

149
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,200
have very much data use going on.

150
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,340
And again, why is that?

151
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,930
Because people are not able to see the data quality issues.

152
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:58,680
There&#39;s no transparency, there&#39;s no data trust.

153
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,850
And these are things that the validation rules

154
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,900
can really help with.

155
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,720
All right, let&#39;s get in a little bit more technical here.

156
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,470
What exactly is a validation rule?

157
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,100
It&#39;s an expression that defines a relationship

158
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,273
between a number of data elements essentially.

159
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:15,930
The expression has a left side,

160
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,600
a right side and an operator in between.

161
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,660
We can think back to our grade school math days here,

162
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,900
we have a left side, we have a right side,

163
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,040
and then we have an equals greater than,

164
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,293
or less than in between those.

165
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,800
You create validation rules,

166
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,360
based on what you know to be true.

167
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,440
This is very, very important.

168
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,690
And I&#39;ll say it again.

169
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,360
You create validation rules,

170
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,433
based upon what you know to be true.

171
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,360
The reason that you need to appreciate this and DHI2S

172
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,360
is because in other statistical analysis software

173
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,837
that maybe you&#39;re using, this is the opposite

174
00:07:50,837 --> 00:07:52,810
where you make validation rules based

175
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,140
upon what you know to not be true.

176
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:57,747
But in DHIS2, you define validation rules,

177
00:07:57,747 --> 00:08:00,703
what you know to be true, what should be happening?

178
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:05,450
The example here is, Malaria RDT positive.

179
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:07,550
The number of positive malaria tests

180
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,540
should always be less than

181
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,600
the number of malaria RDT tested done.

182
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,893
How can you have more positive case tests,

183
00:08:15,893 --> 00:08:20,023
than you have total number of tests completed?

184
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,330
If you have more positive tests,

185
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:25,630
then you actually have total number of tested.

186
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,620
There&#39;s an issue, there&#39;s a problem there.

187
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,410
It&#39;s either a problem with the malaria positive,

188
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,850
the number of positive tests

189
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,750
or an issue with the number of malaria tested.

190
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,090
But clearly there&#39;s an issue,

191
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,670
&#39;cause you know that you can&#39;t have more positives

192
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,780
than you have tested.

193
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,500
So this is a very simple example.

194
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,160
When to use validation rules.

195
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,430
Now, Nora is also going to talk about this

196
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,000
a little bit later.

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,523
I believe either tomorrow or next week,

198
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,910
but validation rules can essentially be used

199
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,883
in three different times.

200
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:03,920
They can be used during aggregate data entry.

201
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,633
So data set, data entry.

202
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,660
I think we&#39;ll be able to show you

203
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:10,830
an example of this a little bit later in the week.

204
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,140
But validation rules can be triggered

205
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,380
while data is being entered.

206
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,120
So for example, if I enter more malaria positives

207
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:22,900
than malaria tested during...

208
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,770
If I&#39;m at a clinic and I&#39;m putting that into my dataset,

209
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,720
a validation rule can be triggered,

210
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,450
and saying, &quot;Hey, you&#39;ve entered data.

211
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,370
that should not be possible.

212
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,120
You should go back and check this.&quot;

213
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,010
They can also be used to block data entry altogether.

214
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:41,053
So we can say that if they enter

215
00:09:41,053 --> 00:09:43,160
more positive than the tested,

216
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,290
don&#39;t allow them to submit that data.

217
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,800
Now that can be a good thing.

218
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,203
It can also be a bad thing.

219
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,740
The general rule of thumb is,

220
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,223
allow users to get their data into the system.

221
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,450
Send them alerts and notifications during data entry,

222
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,810
if necessary.

223
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,890
But typically you want people to be able to put

224
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,140
their data in the system.

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,450
Only for probably the most highly trained users,

226
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:12,690
maybe folks at regional or national level,

227
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:15,980
should you disallow data to be entered

228
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,400
that does not pass.

229
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,663
That&#39;s the best practice or rule of thumb.

230
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,740
Second bullet point here,

231
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,660
validation rules can also be run manually.

232
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:31,660
So you can run data validation, rule analysis at any point,

233
00:10:32,366 --> 00:10:35,260
you can do this before you do a supervision visit

234
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,440
for an individual health facility

235
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,740
or a group of health facilities,

236
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,823
or a group of community health workers.

237
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,410
When you run it manually,

238
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:46,160
it can also trigger emails or SMS alerts

239
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,500
that can be sent out to those

240
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,300
who are assigned to the organizational unit

241
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:54,683
that has prompted or resulted in the validation alert.

242
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,810
So we&#39;ll cover that a little bit today as well.

243
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,180
The last point is that validation rules

244
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,907
can be scheduled to run automatically.

245
00:11:04,907 --> 00:11:08,924
And this is probably the most useful functionality

246
00:11:08,924 --> 00:11:10,770
of validation rules is that,

247
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:13,510
you can schedule validation rules to run periodically,

248
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,190
say weekly monthly.

249
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,190
And then those can send again, alerts, emails, SMS messages,

250
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:26,683
to the various users who can actually go in and correct it.

251
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,390
All right, sorry, go ahead.

252
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,390
Is there a question?

253
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,720
Nope, just unmute the microphone for a second.

254
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,760
All right, so let&#39;s talk about

255
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,430
how we can make a simple validation rule.

256
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,253
Now I&#39;m gonna show you this through PowerPoint slides,

257
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,980
but you can in the exercise, go in and do it yourself.

258
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:57,150
These PowerPoint slides are just direct screenshots

259
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,293
from DHIS2.

260
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,173
So let&#39;s make a simple validation rule.

261
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:07,870
Here, we&#39;re looking at a bar chart

262
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:11,950
that&#39;s showing ANC1 visits, ANC2 visits, that&#39;s blue,

263
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,223
ANC3 that&#39;s red and ANC4 visits, that&#39;s orange.

264
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:20,293
And if you&#39;re not familiar with anti-natal care,

265
00:12:20,293 --> 00:12:25,000
then essentially there are four visits

266
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,090
to the clinic that every pregnant woman should make.

267
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:31,590
And these are to receive different clinical services,

268
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,490
vitamins, minerals, checkups, that kind of stuff,

269
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,503
while the woman is pregnant.

270
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,820
And typically we have relatively high ANC1 visits.

271
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,490
Most women go to their first ANC1 visit,

272
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,600
but over time throughout their pregnancy,

273
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,220
they go to fewer and fewer of the visits.

274
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,770
And by the point we get to ANC4,

275
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,910
we typically see much fewer women going

276
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,183
to the fourth visit than went to the first visit.

277
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,710
Folks out there who work in maternal in child health,

278
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:06,040
you&#39;re saying, &quot;Wait a minute, these are different cohorts.&quot;

279
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,960
Well, yes, that is true.

280
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:12,010
But the model does play itself out fairly consistently

281
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:14,980
and only in certain countries do you have

282
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,903
which may have more seasonal pregnancies.

283
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:22,220
This model doesn&#39;t hold true.

284
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,053
But for the most part,

285
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:27,362
we almost always see that there are fewer ANC4 visits

286
00:13:27,362 --> 00:13:30,040
than there are ANC1 visits.

287
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,500
So let&#39;s make a simple validation rule

288
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,630
that we check for this.

289
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:37,630
So we&#39;re gonna say that ANC4 should be less than

290
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,413
or equal to ANC1.

291
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,440
So what are the steps to build this validation rule?

292
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,840
And more importantly,

293
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,650
what are the steps to actually get

294
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:53,530
this elevation rural built into a notification

295
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:55,070
and pushed out to people?

296
00:13:55,070 --> 00:13:56,980
Well, there&#39;s essentially six steps.

297
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:59,070
One of which is optional though.

298
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,690
The first one is you need to make the validation rule.

299
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,510
I&#39;m gonna show you how to do that just now.

300
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:04,370
Then we need to assign the validation rule

301
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:06,540
to a validation rule group.

302
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,250
Just like we assigned data elements

303
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:11,890
or indicators to various groups.

304
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:14,040
We need to of course test the validation rule.

305
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,690
Testing is so important

306
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:17,510
that I&#39;ve seen some several countries

307
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:20,300
that did not adequately test the validation rules.

308
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,870
And it was a disaster.

309
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:23,600
You need to make sure that you&#39;re testing these

310
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,940
before you actually start to push them out to everyone.

311
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:30,100
You need to make the validation rule notification step four,

312
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,500
make the validation rule notification.

313
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,700
Step five, which is again, optional,

314
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,230
but highly encouraged is you need to schedule

315
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,050
the validation rule group to run automatically.

316
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,887
This has done in the scheduler app.

317
00:14:40,887 --> 00:14:43,540
I&#39;m gonna show you how to do that.

318
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:46,560
The step six, which is not optional.

319
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,690
You definitely need to do this,

320
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,600
is you need to write a protocol and guidelines

321
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,220
on how use the validation rule group.

322
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,890
You need to make sure that every step of the process

323
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:58,030
of performing these data quality checks,

324
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,420
how to run them, when to run them,

325
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,260
who receives what notifications?

326
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,270
You&#39;ve defined, all of that.

327
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:08,743
So that if you have maybe turnover in the organization,

328
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,480
whoever comes after the person who made the validation rules

329
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,950
is able to update, modify and follow

330
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,330
what&#39;s been done previously.

331
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:19,990
And you also need to have control over this process.

332
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:22,850
You don&#39;t want to have just dozens of validation rules

333
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,210
that no one is using that are completely useless,

334
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,313
that are not tested.

335
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,640
As system administrators, as DHIS2 managers

336
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:32,700
or HMEs managers, you need to have a fair amount

337
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:35,777
of control and very clear documentation

338
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:38,143
of the validation rules.

339
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,173
All right.

340
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:44,000
If you want to start making validation rules,

341
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,430
again, I&#39;m gonna go through the slides,

342
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:47,980
but the slides I&#39;m gonna show you

343
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,320
are just step-by-step screenshots of the actual process.

344
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,410
But if you did wanna go in

345
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,500
and make validation rules yourself, this is the link.

346
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,070
It&#39;s a separate instance

347
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:01,830
than what you&#39;ve been working in so far, and you need to go.

348
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,527
So it&#39;s academy.demos.dhs.org/dqapp-config.

349
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,690
So you can copy and paste this link directly

350
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,000
into your web browser.

351
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,520
We recommend that you use Chrome

352
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,653
and you&#39;ll be able to start building your validation rules.

353
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,853
All right.

354
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,320
So what&#39;s the first step to making a validation rule?

355
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,400
Well, we&#39;re gonna go to the maintenance app

356
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,489
and in the maintenance app,

357
00:16:26,489 --> 00:16:30,210
we can click on the validation on the top header bar.

358
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,760
So you see that&#39;s underlined in orange

359
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,230
at the top of the screenshot.

360
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,570
If we wanna make a new one,

361
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:39,150
we just go down to the add new button,

362
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,740
which is that blue button right

363
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,873
at the bottom right corner of the screen.

364
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,390
Let&#39;s go step-by-step here.

365
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,680
You see the steps are numbered on the right.

366
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,580
All right, so follow with me as I speak through the steps.

367
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,650
If you&#39;re following along,

368
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:59,010
you&#39;re actually building this validation rule

369
00:16:59,010 --> 00:17:00,803
as I&#39;m going through it right now,

370
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,760
what you need to do is you need to give

371
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,273
the validation rule a very clear name.

372
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:09,203
And this example,

373
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:11,720
we&#39;re calling it ANC1 greater than ANC4.

374
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:18,120
And then if you are building this validation rule

375
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,830
in the demo database,

376
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,180
recommend that you put hyphen your name

377
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,106
so that you can go in and you can remember

378
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:27,433
which validation rule is yours.

379
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:30,990
Then it&#39;s not necessary.

380
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,860
It&#39;s not compulsory,

381
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,310
but we recommend that you do give it a short name.

382
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,890
And then of course we do recommend that all data is coded

383
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,760
or all metadata is coded.

384
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,410
So that&#39;s the third step here,

385
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:42,920
not again necessary,

386
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,448
but it is strongly recommended that you have

387
00:17:45,448 --> 00:17:48,760
some kind of coding procedure or coding methodology

388
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,780
for all of your metadata items

389
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:54,610
so that it helps keep your metadata more organized

390
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,410
and allows you to certainly system administrators,

391
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,500
to query the database more quickly and easily

392
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,550
to pull up any kinds of issues that you may have.

393
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,100
Anyways, not compulsory,

394
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,363
but we do recommend short names and codes.

395
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:11,660
Then the description.

396
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,290
Now, the description is very important.

397
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,383
This is step two.

398
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,156
You need to provide a clear description of what it is,

399
00:18:20,156 --> 00:18:21,510
what they&#39;re actually looking at.

400
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,260
So in this one, it says ANC4

401
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,503
should not be greater than ANC1.

402
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,010
Then after the description,

403
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,493
we can provide some instructions.

404
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,850
Again, not compulsory,

405
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:35,740
but highly recommended that you put

406
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,290
in some clear instructions.

407
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,650
You see, in this one, we have ANC4

408
00:18:39,650 --> 00:18:42,340
should be greater than ANC1.

409
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:46,463
Please check these two values and correct.

410
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,490
So imagine the situation where this validation is triggered.

411
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,490
Someone has put in the ANC4 is greater than ANC1,

412
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:00,360
what should you tell them to do?

413
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,830
Then you need to provide them very clear instructions.

414
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,970
And then that&#39;s the place to put it here

415
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:08,803
in the instructions.

416
00:19:08,803 --> 00:19:09,970
Again, don&#39;t make people guess

417
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,450
what they need to do about their problems.

418
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,047
Tell them specifically.

419
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:19,370
Step four is to assign an importance.

420
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,340
And let me tell you a little bit about what this means.

421
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,140
So this is completely up to you.

422
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:28,140
We have a high, a medium and a low option for importance.

423
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:33,170
And the default is medium,

424
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,400
but you could use this importance

425
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,340
for a couple of different reasons.

426
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:40,273
And I&#39;ll tell you two different examples right now.

427
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:44,960
There are some countries and projects

428
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:48,980
that give validation rules at high importance

429
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,980
if that validation triggers an alert for something

430
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:57,430
that they know to be wrong.

431
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,393
For example, if you have more tested than treated,

432
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,812
you know that one of those numbers is wrong.

433
00:20:06,812 --> 00:20:11,240
There&#39;s no way physically that you can have more...

434
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,150
If you&#39;re monitoring just those

435
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,830
who are treated after receiving tests,

436
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:20,860
there&#39;s no way that you can have more treated than tested.

437
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:22,610
Now, I know some of you epidemiologists

438
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:23,443
are out there saying,

439
00:20:23,443 --> 00:20:24,540
&quot;Well, what about clinical malaria,

440
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,720
People who aren&#39;t tested?&quot;

441
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,403
But if you just bear with me,

442
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,490
what I&#39;m saying is those who are treated after tested,

443
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,173
if you have more treated who weren&#39;t tested,

444
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,400
you know that&#39;s not something

445
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,390
that can actually possibly happen.

446
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:45,070
So you give that validation rule, high importance,

447
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:47,550
because you know one of those numbers is wrong.

448
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:51,817
And then whoever receives that notification knows that,

449
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,610
&quot;Hey, this is high priority.

450
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,220
One of these numbers is wrong.

451
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,430
Something needs to be corrected.&quot;

452
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:00,120
That&#39;s one way of doing it.

453
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,770
The other way of doing it is setting

454
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,040
the high priority validation rules

455
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,795
for disease outbreak monitoring.

456
00:21:07,795 --> 00:21:10,300
Now, this is a little bit of a different concept

457
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,490
to what we&#39;ve been talking about.

458
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:14,950
You can use validation rules for disease surveillance.

459
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,180
For example, you could say the number of Ebola cases

460
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,653
should always be equal to zero.

461
00:21:21,988 --> 00:21:23,080
What happens?

462
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,550
As soon as one health facility reports

463
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:30,240
a single case of Ebola, it will trigger a validation alert.

464
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,453
People receive SMS, just people receive emails.

465
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,697
And then all of a sudden, everybody knows,

466
00:21:37,697 --> 00:21:40,340
&quot;Hey, there was a case of Ebola reported,

467
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,120
we need to go out and do something about it.&quot;

468
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,010
Several countries in west Africa use validation rules

469
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:49,470
and high importance validation rules,

470
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,620
specifically for disease outbreak and monitoring

471
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,453
in this way.

472
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,870
Then you need to define your period.

473
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:59,950
And your period, step five here,

474
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:04,620
should be set to at least the same as the frequency

475
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,870
in which the data is captured.

476
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,130
So if your data&#39;s captured monthly,

477
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:11,500
then you should set your period to at least a monthly.

478
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,760
You can&#39;t set it to weekly.

479
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,860
You can&#39;t set it to daily.

480
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,020
That would not work.

481
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,610
You need to at least set it to monthly.

482
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,027
However, you could set it to like quarterly or annually.

483
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:22,460
And what would happen is that this validation rule

484
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,080
would aggregate that data from those months to that quarter,

485
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,350
in which you&#39;re doing the analysis, if that makes sense.

486
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:31,760
But the general rule of thumb is that you just set

487
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,010
the validation rule to the same period

488
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,760
at which you&#39;re capturing the data.

489
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,660
After you go through those steps,

490
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:45,070
you need to define the left side and the right side.

491
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:49,530
Here, I&#39;m going to just quickly show you.

492
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,363
This is the left side generator.

493
00:22:55,349 --> 00:22:57,220
And how about this?

494
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,530
I think I&#39;ve stretched that a lot.

495
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:01,303
Let me just go in and...

496
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:12,640
I&#39;m just gonna show you,

497
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,430
this is a little bit easier to show it to you

498
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:19,093
than to present it on a slide.

499
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,420
The left side and the right side.

500
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:27,191
So I&#39;ve gone into the maintenance app.

501
00:23:27,191 --> 00:23:29,620
I&#39;m gonna go to my validations.

502
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,490
I&#39;m going to list my validation rules

503
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,720
and yeah, great, looks like some folks

504
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,310
are already in here doing this.

505
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,170
I&#39;m gonna click on one validation rule here,

506
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:42,433
which is ANC2 should be less than or equal to ANC1.

507
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,090
And I&#39;m going to...

508
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,490
so I&#39;ve defined my period.

509
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,570
I&#39;ve defined my importance.

510
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:50,920
Now I&#39;m gonna go into my left side.

511
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,220
I&#39;m gonna zoom in a little bit for you here.

512
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,570
That&#39;s a little bit bigger.

513
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,763
If I go into my left side,

514
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:03,230
then the first thing is you needed to find

515
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,130
is your value missed...

516
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,080
Oh, sorry, excuse me.

517
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,030
Missing value strategy.

518
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,410
So you have three options.

519
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:13,280
You can say skip if any value is missing,

520
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:17,190
skip if all values are missing or never skip.

521
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:20,810
All right, this depends upon which one you choose.

522
00:24:20,810 --> 00:24:23,890
Depends upon the different data elements

523
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:26,403
that you&#39;ve included in your expression.

524
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,410
Typically I would say more often than not.

525
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:34,410
You want to probably have skip

526
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:37,160
if all values are missing or skip if any values are missing,

527
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,940
you don&#39;t want validation rules to be triggered

528
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:41,933
if there&#39;s no values there.

529
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:44,290
It&#39;s not usually good practice

530
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,860
if they&#39;re just missing values,

531
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,703
so DHIS2 will stand in a zero value.

532
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,087
So I&#39;m actually gonna change this.

533
00:24:53,087 --> 00:24:58,087
I&#39;m gonna say skip, if all values are missing.

534
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:00,585
&#39;Cause why did I do that?

535
00:25:00,585 --> 00:25:05,168
Well, I actually have two different data elements here,

536
00:25:07,013 --> 00:25:09,762
so I have ANC second visits fixed,

537
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:12,743
plus ANC second visits outreach.

538
00:25:12,743 --> 00:25:13,928
So I&#39;m gonna say skip,

539
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:16,178
if all values are missing for these two here.

540
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,850
Okay, the next thing that I want to point out is...

541
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:24,873
One second.

542
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:32,250
This sliding window.

543
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:34,830
What does sliding window mean?

544
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,700
Well, the great thing about DHIS2 these days

545
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,321
is that we have a lot of user documentation out there.

546
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:43,970
There&#39;s a lot of resources out there.

547
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,710
So what I&#39;m gonna do just to show you the processes,

548
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,233
I&#39;m just gonna Google, DHIS2 sliding window.

549
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,320
You can see I&#39;ve Googled this before.

550
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,610
And so what&#39;s my first link?

551
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:02,117
It&#39;s a link to the master user documentation,

552
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:05,863
let me click on that, see where that takes me.

553
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:09,770
Well, I think I found my answer right here

554
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,363
about sliding windows.

555
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,300
I&#39;ll just give you a quick summary of what this is.

556
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,810
Now, this is our good functionality

557
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:23,510
and primarily intended for disease surveillance.

558
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,830
So the typical use case for this is

559
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:30,177
if you have a threshold, like an outbreak threshold,

560
00:26:30,177 --> 00:26:32,610
and that threshold for outbreak is calculated on,

561
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,863
may say a weekly or monthly basis.

562
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:41,233
But you have maybe daily data coming into the system.

563
00:26:43,030 --> 00:26:45,890
And what the sliding window will do

564
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,193
is as you move forward in time, as you go from week to week,

565
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,480
and make this validation rule analysis,

566
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,230
the days will follow you incrementally

567
00:26:58,230 --> 00:26:59,230
as you move forward in time.

568
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,470
And that&#39;s actually what you see this little diagram

569
00:27:01,470 --> 00:27:02,580
that&#39;s playing out.

570
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,500
You see that we&#39;re going

571
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,413
from week one to week two to week three.

572
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:10,660
And our threshold for week one is 10.

573
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,700
Our threshold for week two is nine.

574
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:17,853
And our threshold for week three is eight.

575
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:24,030
And you can see that the number of cases is...

576
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,900
And that threshold is calculated on a weekly basis,

577
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,380
but as we move forward in time,

578
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,170
we&#39;re getting more and more cases reported in.

579
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,191
And so you see that our number of cases

580
00:27:33,191 --> 00:27:35,900
is changing every day.

581
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,900
And that sliding window allows you to go period

582
00:27:40,971 --> 00:27:44,623
by period or day by day as new data comes in.

583
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:51,937
So instead of the alternative would be that on week two,

584
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,940
the validation would only run for and say,

585
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,613
you&#39;re on Monday of week two.

586
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,560
First day of week two,

587
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:04,210
the validation would only count the data

588
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:08,163
that&#39;s entered for Monday against the weekly threshold.

589
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,660
That doesn&#39;t actually really work well

590
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,960
in disease surveillance.

591
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,160
We want this sliding window.

592
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,070
We want the data to be aggregated

593
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:18,190
as we move through time, day after day.

594
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,900
I appreciate this as a bit of a nuanced thing,

595
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,350
those epidemiologists out there,

596
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:27,160
hopefully you appreciate what we&#39;re trying to go for here.

597
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,390
Again, sliding windows are principally used

598
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:31,140
for disease surveillance,

599
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,170
and using validation rules for like outbreak detection

600
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:40,563
or against say like a threshold, an outbreak threshold.

601
00:28:42,352 --> 00:28:44,100
If you have more specific questions on that,

602
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,313
I&#39;m happy to go into it in more detail.

603
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:50,460
But for now I think we just have to keep moving on.

604
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:56,910
So the next step is that we actually need to build

605
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,870
our expression.

606
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:02,830
So here you see, we have ANC first visits fixed,

607
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:03,663
ANC second...

608
00:29:03,663 --> 00:29:05,450
Oh sorry, ANC second visits fixed,

609
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:07,540
ANC second visits outreach.

610
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:11,630
Just for the sake of showing you, I&#39;m going to delete those.

611
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,060
And you see that when I deleted those

612
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:16,800
and I deleted those in this expression builder field here,

613
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,560
they says the expression is empty.

614
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:21,617
See the translator down at the bottom is saying,

615
00:29:21,617 --> 00:29:23,177
&quot;Hey, you&#39;ve got nothing here.&quot;

616
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,350
So how am I gonna build this?

617
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:27,810
I am gonna come over to the right side.

618
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,760
I&#39;m gonna leave.

619
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,160
I&#39;m gonna select data elements,

620
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,860
and I&#39;m gonna search for my ANC2 visits.

621
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:38,860
So I&#39;m gonna search ANC2 and here they&#39;re.

622
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,980
And I have fixed an outreach.

623
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:44,790
I&#39;m going to double click on fixed.

624
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,143
You see that it comes here.

625
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,840
And this thing that you see here,

626
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,170
this hashtag and then brackets

627
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,330
and seemingly random series of letters and numbers

628
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:59,063
is the unique identifier of this data element.

629
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:05,573
This is how DHIS2 stores this data element in the backend.

630
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:13,100
All right, so, if you&#39;re curious on how to query the API

631
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:16,370
for different metadata items,

632
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:20,290
the easiest way to do it is through the UID of them.

633
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:21,810
Anyways, you still have to deal with it here

634
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:23,690
as you&#39;re building the validation rules.

635
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,707
So I&#39;m gonna say ANC second visit fixed,

636
00:30:26,707 --> 00:30:29,420
plus ANC second, visit outreach.

637
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:32,793
So here I&#39;d just click the plus button and I click outreach.

638
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,340
And then here you go, we&#39;re back to our original expression.

639
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,203
So just this plus this.

640
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,899
I won&#39;t go over all of these various other operators.

641
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:45,140
There&#39;s clear documentation of what these do.

642
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,500
Hopefully most of these are quite clear,

643
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:50,123
like multiplication, division, minus, addition.

644
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:55,983
Counts the number of days in the org unit,

645
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:59,790
in the period that you are running the validation for.

646
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:02,340
So if you have a monthly validation

647
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,890
and you are running that validation for October,

648
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:09,353
it would say that there&#39;s 31 days in October.

649
00:31:10,290 --> 00:31:12,860
So that would substitute a value of the number

650
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,510
of days in the period at which you&#39;re running

651
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,460
the validation for.

652
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,553
All right, so I&#39;m gonna save this,

653
00:31:20,788 --> 00:31:25,030
After that you have to select an operator.

654
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:26,370
You see that we have quite

655
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,470
a number of different operators equals two,

656
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,320
not equal to greater than greater than,

657
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,830
or equal to less than compulsory repair.

658
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,770
Compulsory repair means that both values have to be there.

659
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,830
That one value cannot be missing.

660
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,150
That the left side has to be there

661
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,990
and the right side has to be there.

662
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,010
You also have exclusive pairs,

663
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:47,160
which means that one side has to be there.

664
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,660
If the left side is there,

665
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,493
then the right side cannot be there.

666
00:31:56,942 --> 00:31:59,310
And then we have to define our right side,

667
00:31:59,310 --> 00:32:02,310
defining the right side is just like defining the left side.

668
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:06,970
Then we have to assign...

669
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:09,070
Well, you don&#39;t actually have to do this,

670
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:11,530
but you can assign the org unit level

671
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,860
for which you want the validation rule to run.

672
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,060
If you leave this blank,

673
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:17,230
if I don&#39;t assign any of these,

674
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,490
then what it&#39;ll do is it&#39;ll run the validation rule

675
00:32:19,490 --> 00:32:22,440
at the level at which the data is captured,

676
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,220
that triggers that validation rule.

677
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:26,130
So this data is captured at facility level.

678
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:28,840
So it would provide the validation at facility level.

679
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,350
If I turned on say district level,

680
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,510
then what do I actually do is run the validation

681
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:37,050
at district level, not run it at facility level,

682
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:40,170
and it will aggregate the data to the district.

683
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,530
So all the facility level data

684
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,750
will be aggregated to the district.

685
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:46,490
In this case, all of the data for ANC2,

686
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,800
across all the facilities,

687
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,130
will be aggravated to the district.

688
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:52,040
All the data for ANC1 across all the facilities

689
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,590
will be aggregated to the district.

690
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:56,140
And if the validation doesn&#39;t pass at the district,

691
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,440
then you&#39;ll receive an alert for the district.

692
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,160
The last tick that we can say

693
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,430
is skipped the rule during form validation.

694
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,190
Now this allows by default,

695
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,370
the validation rules

696
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:15,370
will produce alerts during data entry in the dataset.

697
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,793
If you don&#39;t want that to happen, then you take this box.

698
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,330
But by default, the box is not ticked,

699
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:26,130
if we go in to a dataset into a data entry form,

700
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,720
we start entering data.

701
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,610
And we say that ANC2 is greater than ANC1.

702
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:32,423
Then you&#39;ll see a alert pop-up.

703
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,083
If I tick this box, then the alert will not pop up.

704
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:44,770
Let&#39;s get back into the PowerPoint.

705
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:47,100
I think we can actually skip ahead a bit.

706
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,800
We&#39;ve covered all of this already.

707
00:33:51,977 --> 00:33:55,493
The next step is you need to make a validation rule group.

708
00:33:58,291 --> 00:34:03,291
And the validation rule groups, making these is very simple.

709
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,970
Again, in the maintenance you go to validation rule group,

710
00:34:05,970 --> 00:34:08,108
and you just group your validation rules together.

711
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:10,520
So if you have all of your ANC validation rules,

712
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,170
you can put those into one group.

713
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,330
So the next step is that we need to cover

714
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,690
before we&#39;re able to break,

715
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,690
is going through building validation rule notifications.

716
00:34:24,382 --> 00:34:26,010
So, because we&#39;re actually running

717
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:27,350
a little bit of short on time.

718
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,510
I&#39;m gonna skip through running the validation rules.

719
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,840
I believe that we&#39;ll be able to come back

720
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,303
to that later in the week.

721
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,940
So I&#39;m just gonna show you how to build

722
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:40,263
the validation rule notifications now.

723
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:49,984
So let&#39;s again, do this one together.

724
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:56,570
So I&#39;m back in the maintenance app.

725
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,040
I&#39;m gonna go to validation rule notification.

726
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,970
You see that on the left side of the screen,

727
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:02,080
we see that Robert,

728
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,630
Robert you&#39;re winning the prize today

729
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,010
and (indistinct), you&#39;re also doing a great job.

730
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,140
So you&#39;re already a bit ahead of the pack here.

731
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,832
Let&#39;s just add one together though.

732
00:35:12,832 --> 00:35:17,299
So I&#39;m going to click the plus button

733
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:19,549
in the bottom right corner like we always do.

734
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:30,060
And I am going to give this a name.

735
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,277
I am just gonna call it ANC4, less than ANC1.

736
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,310
I&#39;ll give it my name, -Scott,

737
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,410
just so, I can find it later if I want.

738
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:51,090
Obviously, if you&#39;re making these in your system

739
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:53,308
in your actual DHIS2 instance,

740
00:35:53,308 --> 00:35:56,420
you don&#39;t put hyphen in your name,

741
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,200
I&#39;m just doing it now because we&#39;re all building

742
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,023
and sharing inside of one database.

743
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:01,983
All right.

744
00:36:01,983 --> 00:36:04,190
And then we need to find our validation rules

745
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,023
that we want to use.

746
00:36:05,023 --> 00:36:07,580
So I am just gonna randomly six because Robert

747
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,650
was the first one I saw this morning.

748
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,010
I&#39;m gonna choose Roberts.

749
00:36:11,010 --> 00:36:13,900
Hopefully Robert, your validation rule is working properly.

750
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,250
We&#39;ll find out in a minute.

751
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:20,610
And then we need to define our recipient groups.

752
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:24,760
Now we can send this to different org...

753
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,543
Sorry, user groups.

754
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:28,830
This is not necessary.

755
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:33,830
You could have it sent to notify users in hierarchy only.

756
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,490
That&#39;s also an option.

757
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,410
So what does that mean?

758
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:41,400
That means that anyone who is assigned to this org unit

759
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,850
would receive this notification.

760
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,720
But it&#39;s also generally best practice

761
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,640
that you have different user groups.

762
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,220
Maybe you have a user group for disease surveillance

763
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,373
or disease response.

764
00:36:55,609 --> 00:36:57,890
And any validation rules that are associated

765
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,480
with disease surveillance,

766
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,520
they should maybe be sent to this user group.

767
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,910
Even if the validations are coming

768
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:07,843
from places that that user is not really associated with.

769
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:12,690
So this is an option here.

770
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:15,380
It&#39;s completely up to you to decide and how best to use it.

771
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,680
But like I said,

772
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,090
it&#39;s useful to make various user groups,

773
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:21,940
based upon different kinds of associations or projects

774
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,793
or different roles within the system.

775
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,350
I am going to say, though,

776
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,310
I wanna notify users in the hierarchy.

777
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,580
And you can see that you can do both.

778
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,340
You can say, I wanna send it to this user group

779
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,853
and notify users in the hierarchy, for example.

780
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,190
And then it&#39;s important.

781
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:44,530
The next step is you have to define

782
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:45,990
how you send the notifications.

783
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:47,980
Do you wanna send it as a collective summary

784
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,580
or as a single notification?

785
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,770
I&#39;ll show you an example of this in a minute,

786
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,690
but essentially a collective summary we&#39;ll group,

787
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,340
all of the validation rules into a single message.

788
00:37:58,340 --> 00:38:01,630
So for example, if you have 20 validation alerts triggered,

789
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:03,870
then it will send it in a single email.

790
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,066
If you say single notifications,

791
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:09,810
then it was send those 20 different validation alerts

792
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:10,900
as separate emails.

793
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:13,620
So instead of you receiving one email with 20,

794
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:15,733
you will receive 20 emails with one.

795
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,940
Again, depends on the different strategy

796
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,160
and purpose of the validation rule.

797
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,180
I would say the general rule of thumb though,

798
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,400
is try to minimize the number of emails that people receive.

799
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,760
People receive too many emails, it just becomes noise.

800
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,650
They start paying attention to it.

801
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,710
Most countries, most projects I&#39;ve seen

802
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,763
have found it more useful use collective summary.

803
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,140
Then we have to define a message.

804
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:47,140
And this message you&#39;ll find can be relative

805
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,580
to the validation rule.

806
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:52,530
So you see, we have our template variables

807
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,210
over here on the right side.

808
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,110
So we can use these,

809
00:38:56,110 --> 00:39:00,460
drop these into our subject template.

810
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:04,460
And it will automatically fill in these for us.

811
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,050
So I&#39;m gonna say rule name

812
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:13,370
has been triggered for, let&#39;s say organizational unit.

813
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:24,030
So whatever facility, on actually for the period.

814
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,740
So (indistinct) did the validation will get triggered for?

815
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:33,050
And then I&#39;ll say on the current date.

816
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,240
So the date at which the validation rule

817
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,760
was the validation rule analysis actually took place.

818
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,590
So it&#39;ll say in this case,

819
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:45,590
the translation for this would be ANC1 minus ANC4

820
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,880
Robert has been triggered for,

821
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,880
let&#39;s say like facility 146 for October, 2020

822
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,263
on the 22nd of October.

823
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,530
So that&#39;s the subject short, but sweet

824
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,590
but gives a lot of good information.

825
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,950
And for the message template,

826
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:11,620
we can make this even a little bit longer.

827
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:16,380
We could say something similar, like validation rule name

828
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:21,430
with validation rule description

829
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:29,000
has a left side description of left side value

830
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:40,550
and right side description of right side value.

831
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,750
Then maybe we drop in at organizational unit on the period.

832
00:41:10,272 --> 00:41:11,120
This is incorrect.

833
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:16,120
Please follow the data quality SoPs, something like that.

834
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,270
So it&#39;s just a longer message is giving

835
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,550
the user more information about

836
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:24,793
what&#39;s the validation rule?

837
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,260
What was the description of the validation rule?

838
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:30,100
What are the actual values that are triggering

839
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,200
the validation rule?

840
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,190
Where&#39;s it at?

841
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,650
When was it?

842
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,930
And then giving them maybe some more specific instructions

843
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:37,660
about how to actually correct it.

844
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,510
Again, if you remember earlier, we were talking about,

845
00:41:39,510 --> 00:41:42,000
it&#39;s very important to give specific instructions

846
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,290
on how to correct the validation rules

847
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:49,660
in the validation rule notifications.

848
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,140
So if this happens to someone,

849
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,400
they received this notification,

850
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,500
what specifically should they do about it?

851
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,623
This one is quite vague.

852
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:00,400
Please follow the data, quality SoPs.

853
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:05,400
You could say, review during monthly data quality,

854
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,960
verification meeting or something like that.

855
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,830
We can make it specific to whatever actually

856
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,210
is your standard operating procedures

857
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:23,540
or your processes in your project or country.

858
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:25,020
All right, so that is making

859
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,717
the validation rule notification.

860
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:29,863
I&#39;m just gonna pop back over to my PowerPoint.

861
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,503
I&#39;m gonna skip how to run the validation rules.

862
00:42:36,503 --> 00:42:38,803
We&#39;ll be able to come back to this.

863
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:56,960
So when to run your validation rules,

864
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,793
now there&#39;s a point here.

865
00:42:57,793 --> 00:42:59,017
I do wanna make this quite clear,

866
00:42:59,017 --> 00:43:01,913
and I made reference alluded to this earlier.

867
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:09,393
When you&#39;re configuring your data set, there is a tick box.

868
00:43:10,365 --> 00:43:11,880
And that&#39;s what you see on the right side

869
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:12,830
of the screen here.

870
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:17,780
This is a screenshot of configuring a dataset.

871
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:19,720
The dataset is reproductive health,

872
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,860
and you see where the red box is,

873
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:25,396
it says complete allowed only if validation passes

874
00:43:25,396 --> 00:43:27,230
and you see that that box is ticked.

875
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:29,080
Now, what does that actually do?

876
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:31,400
That means that any validation rules

877
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,840
that are associated with the data

878
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:35,890
that&#39;s being entered for that dataset,

879
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:39,760
if there&#39;s a validation notification that is triggered,

880
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:40,593
what happens?

881
00:43:40,593 --> 00:43:44,090
It means that that data set will not be allowed

882
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,460
to be marked complete,

883
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,150
which means the data that was entered

884
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:51,620
for that dataset will still be in the system.

885
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:52,920
But that means it won&#39;t show up

886
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:55,430
in your reporting rate analysis.

887
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,000
Datasets have to be marked complete

888
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,653
in order to show up for a reporting rate analysis.

889
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:04,190
Now, this can be a good thing.

890
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:06,140
If you have highly trained staff

891
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:10,110
who know how to correct the data quality issues,

892
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:13,140
and you have very clearly defined validation rules

893
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,940
with good descriptions and good instructions

894
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:16,560
that tells them exactly what they need to do.

895
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,290
In most cases though, in my experience,

896
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,453
this has caused a lot of problems.

897
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:24,940
The reason it&#39;s caused a lot of problems

898
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:27,510
is because people have not clearly defined

899
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:28,610
their validation rules.

900
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:29,710
They&#39;ve not clearly defined

901
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,530
their validation rule instructions, their district staff,

902
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:34,670
the people who are putting them data in

903
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:38,110
or facility staff are not highly trained.

904
00:44:38,110 --> 00:44:40,660
And it just means that people are trying

905
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:43,580
to put the data in the best they know how.

906
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,003
And they&#39;re being prevented from being able to do that.

907
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:52,530
There is one country I worked in who had one validation rule

908
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:53,380
that was configured

909
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:56,240
that it was not possible of being passed.

910
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,513
There was no way to pass the validation rule.

911
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,910
And this was the main data set that they had

912
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:03,743
for the country.

913
00:45:03,743 --> 00:45:05,930
It was the monthly facility reporting dataset,

914
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:07,163
the major dataset.

915
00:45:08,070 --> 00:45:10,225
And it prevented people from the district

916
00:45:10,225 --> 00:45:12,730
and the city levels from being able to mark

917
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:15,560
that data set complete for a couple of years

918
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,770
before they noticed the problem.

919
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,050
And that means that they had no reporting rate data

920
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,510
for years.

921
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,240
So they asked what we could do.

922
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,020
All we did was go in and tick the box.

923
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:28,770
That was it. That was the easiest fix.

924
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:31,453
I think I&#39;ve ever had for DHIS2 to be honest with you.

925
00:45:32,490 --> 00:45:34,690
And what did that then do it allowed them

926
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,154
to put the data in

927
00:45:36,154 --> 00:45:39,743
and we reinforce the data, quality checks, post data entry.

928
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:42,273
All right.

929
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:44,950
Now I wanna show you quickly before we break

930
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:45,970
in a few minutes,

931
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:50,310
on how to schedule validation rules.

932
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:51,143
So we talked about,

933
00:45:51,143 --> 00:45:53,180
you can actually schedule the validation rules

934
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:56,170
and they can send out automatic notifications.

935
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,280
So we&#39;ve talked about how to make the validation rules.

936
00:45:58,280 --> 00:45:59,730
We&#39;ve shown you how to make

937
00:45:59,730 --> 00:46:01,420
the validation rule notification.

938
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:03,320
Now we&#39;re gonna show you the last part of the job,

939
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,150
which is scheduling the validation rules

940
00:46:05,150 --> 00:46:07,250
to run automatically.

941
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,040
And so there&#39;s an app for this.

942
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,140
The app is called The Scheduler App.

943
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:14,760
This app is again an app that should only be accessible

944
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:16,550
to system administrators.

945
00:46:16,550 --> 00:46:18,110
This is not an app that you want anyone

946
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,290
to be able to go in and do stuff with.

947
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,640
But if you&#39;re a system administrator,

948
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,370
you should be able to use this application,

949
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:25,950
The Scheduler App.

950
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:28,700
And what we&#39;re gonna do is we&#39;re actually go in

951
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,897
and we&#39;re gonna make a monitoring job.

952
00:46:31,897 --> 00:46:34,303
And so I&#39;m gonna walk through the screenshots here.

953
00:46:36,090 --> 00:46:40,582
When you go in to make a new job in the scheduler app,

954
00:46:40,582 --> 00:46:43,170
you first have to define...

955
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,400
You have to of course give it a name,

956
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,240
just like we do with everything else.

957
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,190
Give it a name in this case,

958
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:49,270
we&#39;re going to call it ANC,

959
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:51,780
and then you have to schedule

960
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,333
when the job will execute.

961
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:56,470
All right,

962
00:46:56,470 --> 00:46:59,442
you have three options for this.

963
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:03,930
And the first option which is that first orange box

964
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,350
on the far left.

965
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:08,680
You see that you can use a predefined frequency.

966
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,920
So you see that we have five predefined frequencies there,

967
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:14,010
every hour, every day at midnight,

968
00:47:14,010 --> 00:47:17,540
every day at 3:00 am, every day at noon every week.

969
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:22,330
So these are your options for predefined.

970
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:24,130
If you want a different frequency,

971
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,840
say you want the first day of every month,

972
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,750
then you have to put a chronic suppression.

973
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,780
Now, if you are a server administrator

974
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:35,800
or anyone with a bit of background in software development,

975
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,610
you know what a chronic depression is,

976
00:47:37,610 --> 00:47:40,840
but if you&#39;re not familiar with chronic expressions,

977
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,010
all I can say is you should just Google it.

978
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:45,580
There are a lot of great chronic depression builders,

979
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,270
out there in the world.

980
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:48,103
You don&#39;t necessarily

981
00:47:48,103 --> 00:47:49,880
have to know anything coding or anything.

982
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,787
You just have to be able to say,

983
00:47:51,787 --> 00:47:53,190
&quot;I want something to run

984
00:47:53,190 --> 00:47:56,613
at the first day of the month at 1:00 am.

985
00:47:57,700 --> 00:48:00,120
And then there&#39;s chronic suppression builders out there

986
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,170
that will give you the syntax for that.

987
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:04,633
And you can copy and paste it here into DHIS.

988
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:11,020
The other alternative is to have continuous execution.

989
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,600
Continuous execution means that it will constantly run.

990
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,070
As soon as it finishes, it will run again.

991
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:21,390
Now this may be good for a few situations.

992
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:23,700
The first one is disease surveillance.

993
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:28,290
If you are monitoring just one or two validation rules

994
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,350
that are used for disease surveillance,

995
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:32,620
you can have this continuously running.

996
00:48:32,620 --> 00:48:35,380
That&#39;s not going to tax your system very much.

997
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,830
But if you&#39;re using,

998
00:48:37,830 --> 00:48:41,600
say you want to make an expression or a job

999
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,510
that will check maybe 10 validation rules,

1000
00:48:44,510 --> 00:48:46,533
I guess a monthly dataset.

1001
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:51,140
You do not want that to run continuously.

1002
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:54,300
The reason is, is because that will be very taxing

1003
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,430
to your server.

1004
00:48:55,430 --> 00:48:57,963
It will be very difficult for your server to maintain that

1005
00:48:57,963 --> 00:49:00,140
because the validation rules require

1006
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:02,283
a lot of processing to run.

1007
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:04,790
And if you&#39;re running it continuously,

1008
00:49:04,790 --> 00:49:06,860
you&#39;re going to really slow down

1009
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,483
the performance of your server.

1010
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:11,086
So again, this is useful for disease surveillance.

1011
00:49:11,086 --> 00:49:14,223
If you&#39;re just running for one or two validation rules,

1012
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:19,320
but I highly, highly, highly recommend

1013
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,960
that you do not use it

1014
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,960
if you are running maybe three validation rules or more.

1015
00:49:27,310 --> 00:49:31,790
You&#39;ll really tax the performance of your system.

1016
00:49:31,790 --> 00:49:32,623
All right.

1017
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,000
The next thing that we need to do is to find

1018
00:49:37,012 --> 00:49:38,930
a relative star and a relative in.

1019
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:41,430
Now, this may sound a little bit confusing to you.

1020
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:46,200
And essentially what this is,

1021
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,750
you enter a number here,

1022
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:50,983
you enter either a negative number or positive number,

1023
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,130
and you see here, we&#39;ve entered a negative one

1024
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:56,550
for our relative start.

1025
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:01,330
What this means is this is relative to today,

1026
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:04,540
and it is counting the number of days.

1027
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,440
So a negative one here means yesterday,

1028
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:10,300
yesterday was negative one day from today.

1029
00:50:10,300 --> 00:50:13,900
You see that our relative end is positive one

1030
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:15,830
that is tomorrow.

1031
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:17,480
So what does that mean?

1032
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,620
That means that it will run any of the validation rules

1033
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,370
that are included in this job.

1034
00:50:22,370 --> 00:50:24,620
We&#39;ll check any data that was entered

1035
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:28,410
between yesterday and tomorrow.

1036
00:50:28,410 --> 00:50:30,603
So that&#39;s includes three days.

1037
00:50:32,570 --> 00:50:36,127
But these three days fall within October,

1038
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:46,880
which is one month,

1039
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,470
October falls into one quarter three.

1040
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:54,630
And that these three days follow within one year.

1041
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:59,610
So for example, if I have this job looking

1042
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:01,243
at this the last three days,

1043
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:05,790
then it will also trigger any validation rules

1044
00:51:05,790 --> 00:51:10,683
that are set to monthly and run those for October as well.

1045
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,350
If we fast forward and say that we&#39;re sitting

1046
00:51:15,767 --> 00:51:19,590
in October 31st, today, today is October 31st,

1047
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,140
let&#39;s just imagine that.

1048
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:24,160
And we have our relative start to negative one

1049
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:26,840
and a relative end to one.

1050
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:31,790
That means that tomorrow will be November.

1051
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:34,640
And so it would run the validation rules

1052
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,053
for both October and November.

1053
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:41,273
Because these three days straddle two months,

1054
00:51:42,310 --> 00:51:44,386
hopefully that makes sense to you.

1055
00:51:44,386 --> 00:51:46,693
I know it can be a little bit confusing.

1056
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,040
What&#39;s a good rule of thumb.

1057
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,550
Well, I actually recommend that you use

1058
00:51:54,550 --> 00:51:56,980
a pretty large number for your relative start.

1059
00:51:56,980 --> 00:51:59,590
So something like negative 90 or negative 60

1060
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:00,870
or something like that.

1061
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:03,520
And excuse me, this PowerPoint is not updated.

1062
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:07,070
So negative 90 days is not March 24th.

1063
00:52:07,070 --> 00:52:09,973
Sorry, I&#39;m recycling a PowerPoint presentation here,

1064
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:16,350
but you say relative negative 90 days relative

1065
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:21,470
into maybe just what plus one, which is tomorrow.

1066
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:22,650
You don&#39;t have to put in the plus.

1067
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:24,400
You can just put in the number one.

1068
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:29,290
And negative 90 days to today.

1069
00:52:29,290 --> 00:52:34,260
Well, that covers 91 days that will cover about four months

1070
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,880
I think in this situation,

1071
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:38,380
it will cover two quarters in one year.

1072
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,410
So any data that was entered in the last 91 days,

1073
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:41,540
in the last four months,

1074
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:43,570
the last two quarters of the last year

1075
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:46,443
would be included in this validation check.

1076
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:52,840
The second to last step is that you have to choose

1077
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,500
the validation rule group

1078
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:01,653
or you can add your validation rules one at a time.

1079
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:10,890
You can also say if you want to send notifications.

1080
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:14,150
So again, notifications, where does this come from?

1081
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:18,150
This means that validation of role notification

1082
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,790
that you configured earlier would be sent out

1083
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:25,070
and notifications can be sent via email or SMS or both

1084
00:53:25,070 --> 00:53:28,690
if the notification is configured

1085
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:32,920
and you configured an email server to your DHIS2,

1086
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:36,040
you configured an SMS gateway to your DHIS2

1087
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,760
and the user who is receiving that notification

1088
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:42,430
is configured to receive emails and SMS.

1089
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:44,220
You have to do all four of these

1090
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:47,503
in order for anyone to receive any notifications from DHIS2.

1091
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:50,110
There&#39;s documentation online

1092
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:52,640
about configuring email servers and SMS gateway.

1093
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,370
So we won&#39;t get into that today,

1094
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:55,490
but if you&#39;re struggling with that,

1095
00:53:55,490 --> 00:53:56,930
please send us a message and we can point you

1096
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:00,000
to the documentation and support material for that.

1097
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,673
Or of course answer your questions.

1098
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:04,940
The last one is persists results.

1099
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:07,560
Now, if you take this persist results,

1100
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,640
what it will do is it will save any of the validation rules

1101
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:12,713
that are triggered.

1102
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:17,770
And when this job runs automatically,

1103
00:54:17,770 --> 00:54:19,730
in this case it&#39;s running every day at midnight,

1104
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,880
when this runs automatically,

1105
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,590
any validations that have already been triggered

1106
00:54:24,590 --> 00:54:26,740
will not be shown.

1107
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,670
It will only show the new ones.

1108
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:29,503
Why is that?

1109
00:54:29,503 --> 00:54:32,350
It&#39;s because it&#39;s persisting the results of the old one.

1110
00:54:32,350 --> 00:54:35,358
Now, if you are a DHIS2 expert,

1111
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:38,050
and you know how to query the API,

1112
00:54:38,050 --> 00:54:41,400
these validation rule results are actually saved

1113
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,660
in a data table.

1114
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:44,330
So you can actually start to build analytics

1115
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:45,670
around these if you want.

1116
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:48,030
That&#39;s just for the folks who are DHIS2 experts

1117
00:54:48,030 --> 00:54:49,920
and are familiar with the API.

1118
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,910
If you&#39;re not, you just need to remember

1119
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:54,230
that the functionality here is saving

1120
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,100
the validation rule results,

1121
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:59,690
and when that validation job runs again,

1122
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:02,440
it will only show you the new validation rules

1123
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,413
that have not been shown in the past.

1124
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:10,180
One other consideration is that if you&#39;re having

1125
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:12,510
a lot of validation rule notifications triggered,

1126
00:55:12,510 --> 00:55:13,940
these are being saved onto your server.

1127
00:55:13,940 --> 00:55:16,083
It could take up some server space.

1128
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:23,480
All right, I&#39;m going to skip this for now.

1129
00:55:25,609 --> 00:55:28,695
And I&#39;m gonna show you quickly some examples here.

1130
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:30,940
I know we&#39;re running a little bit over time,

1131
00:55:30,940 --> 00:55:32,900
but let&#39;s take a look at this.

1132
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,070
So this is an example that I made for our demo database.

1133
00:55:37,070 --> 00:55:41,350
And you can see that I made the ANC validation

1134
00:55:41,350 --> 00:55:44,293
or notifications run for the whole country.

1135
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:48,030
This was just two validation rules.

1136
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,580
And what did it do?

1137
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:53,930
Well, it actually ended up sending me 19 emails.

1138
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:56,150
And in those emails contained,

1139
00:55:56,150 --> 00:56:00,023
2000 different validation rule alerts.

1140
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:02,803
Now, is that useful?

1141
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:07,570
Well, certainly receiving 19 automatic emails

1142
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:08,420
is not useful.

1143
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:11,680
And receiving 2000 alerts is completely unuseful.

1144
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:14,650
There&#39;s no way that anyone would be able to respond

1145
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:16,283
to this or do anything about it.

1146
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,780
What do we need to do?

1147
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,830
We need to make sure that our messages are clear

1148
00:56:23,830 --> 00:56:26,890
and concise and are in a manageable amount.

1149
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:31,890
Now, here&#39;s a look at what the actual email said.

1150
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:35,033
So looking in the email itself,

1151
00:56:37,993 --> 00:56:41,959
it says that this health facility has produced

1152
00:56:41,959 --> 00:56:46,959
an alert for ANC2 which is less than or equal to ANC1

1153
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:50,030
for this month.

1154
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:51,980
ANC2 can not be greater than ANC1.

1155
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:56,580
So the message is useful, but I received 2000 of them.

1156
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,350
Now, can I do anything about that?

1157
00:56:58,350 --> 00:56:59,927
Really? No, you cannot.

1158
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:05,030
So we need to ask ourselves,

1159
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:06,420
we have to be very careful about this.

1160
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,010
How and whom can automatic validation,

1161
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:11,243
emails and alerts be useful?

1162
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:14,040
Here is a good example from Rwanda.

1163
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,180
Now, Rwanda is using DHIS2 validation notifications

1164
00:57:17,180 --> 00:57:20,401
for outlier detection.

1165
00:57:20,401 --> 00:57:24,140
And we&#39;re gonna cover how to do that in the next session,

1166
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,370
after our break.

1167
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:27,020
But essentially what they&#39;ve done here.

1168
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,853
And you can see,

1169
00:57:27,853 --> 00:57:31,800
this is an actual email from the Rwandan demo database.

1170
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:35,060
This is not real data, but this is their demo database.

1171
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,510
You can see that

1172
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:43,350
this person received 23 high priority validation rules

1173
00:57:43,350 --> 00:57:44,880
in their email.

1174
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,560
And there&#39;s a clear message.

1175
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,890
So as validation for Penta 3 outlier,

1176
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:50,860
data validation rule has been detected

1177
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,953
at this health facility on this date,

1178
00:57:56,170 --> 00:57:58,680
for this month or for that year.

1179
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:02,110
Please confirm the value is correct for Penta 3.

1180
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:04,120
And they only received 20 notifications.

1181
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:06,330
Now, this person is at district level.

1182
00:58:06,330 --> 00:58:09,850
These health facilities that are producing the alerts

1183
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:13,790
are from their health facilities.

1184
00:58:13,790 --> 00:58:15,730
This is the amount of notifications

1185
00:58:15,730 --> 00:58:17,720
that they can do something about.

1186
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,820
Also the message is quite clear.

1187
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,790
It&#39;s telling them exactly where and when the problem is.

1188
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:24,270
So if you&#39;re a district health officer,

1189
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:26,187
you&#39;re able to receive this email and you&#39;re saying,

1190
00:58:26,187 --> 00:58:29,680
&quot;Okay, I need to go in and I need to check these 23 values.&quot;

1191
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:30,640
How long does that take?

1192
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,380
I don&#39;t know, maybe a few hours.

1193
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,750
Maybe it could take a day.

1194
00:58:33,750 --> 00:58:36,460
But you need to go in and correct these values.

1195
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:39,020
These are suspicious values that need to be corrected.

1196
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,990
This is a great example from what Rwanda has set-up

1197
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:44,600
Here is another one from Cameroon.

1198
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,910
Cameroon is still experimenting with this,

1199
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:51,070
but they have set up some basic alerts

1200
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,190
for disease surveillance.

1201
00:58:53,190 --> 00:58:54,570
And so in this case,

1202
00:58:54,570 --> 00:58:57,778
you see that I won&#39;t translate it for you.

1203
00:58:57,778 --> 00:58:58,910
Those are your friends.

1204
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:01,680
I think there&#39;s a bunch of Cameroonians on the call as well.

1205
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:02,853
This is just a test.

1206
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:07,320
I don&#39;t believe that this is in production yet,

1207
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,560
but you have at least tested using validation rules

1208
00:59:11,560 --> 00:59:12,870
for disease surveillance.

1209
00:59:12,870 --> 00:59:15,580
So you are able to send alerts and notifications

1210
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:19,290
to those who are on disease surveillance response teams,

1211
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:22,240
when there is some outbreaker number of cases

1212
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:23,730
that needs to be investigated.

1213
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:26,820
So another really good example of how this can be used

1214
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:27,653
from Cameroon.

1215
00:59:27,653 --> 00:59:30,720
And again, the person&#39;s only receiving four notifications.

1216
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,330
That&#39;s an actionable number.

1217
00:59:32,330 --> 00:59:36,050
That&#39;s not 2000 notification.

1218
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:40,060
So the last point to be made is that,

1219
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:41,330
again, these notifications

1220
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:42,380
and everything need to be built

1221
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,060
into your standard operating procedures,

1222
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:46,740
and you need to test them thoroughly.

1223
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,117
So that is the end.
