00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,230
- [Instructor] So, I&#39;ve brought up

1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:02,590
a lot of different issues

2
00:00:02,590 --> 00:00:04,770
that are potential challenges

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,010
dealing with system design

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,480
and resulting in poor data quality,

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,400
and also just frustration in terms of creating

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,340
our data outputs.

7
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,070
There are a number of different ways

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:17,700
we can actually review a lot of these issues.

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:19,110
And I think I&#39;ve touched upon

10
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:23,330
kind of identification of a number of these problems.

11
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,560
A lot of them are just manual processes

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,060
where we&#39;re looking at things

13
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,100
like trying to find problems with our forms,

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:33,550
trying to see if there are duplicate categories,

15
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:35,480
if there are duplicate data elements,

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,800
things of that nature.

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,740
So it&#39;s just kind of keeping a sense of our system,

18
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,980
mapping it out.

19
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,760
What might help in terms of eating these manual processes

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,460
is having a kind of mapping a layout of our system.

21
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,820
Things like data dictionaries,

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,100
for example, are kind of immensely helpful

23
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,170
in performing this type of manual review

24
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,070
and identifying if there is all kinds of issues

25
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,550
with desegregations and data elements

26
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:03,220
across our different programs,

27
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,710
whether it be for tracker or for aggregate data.

28
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:06,710
Now, if these are in place,

29
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:10,330
then it makes manual review of these systems a lot easier,

30
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,390
but there are some other things

31
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,240
that we can look at from kind of measuring

32
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,260
a quality perspective and just kind of highlighting

33
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,120
some of these sources of potentially

34
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,790
problematic errors within the system itself.

35
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,900
So we can look at things like the raw number

36
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,030
of data elements, indicators, and data sets,

37
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,940
and just kind of make counts

38
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,820
of this to see if this is in line

39
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,480
with what we would expect based upon

40
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:38,000
the different pieces of information that are collected.

41
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,770
We can also look at poorly defined metadata.

42
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,470
So I&#39;m going to share with you a document

43
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:46,290
on naming conventions that was written

44
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,060
for the WHO digital data packages.

45
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,920
And this is just to give you a flavor

46
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,680
for where you might want to institute

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,300
some naming conventions in the location

48
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,550
that you&#39;re working with.

49
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,970
This is something we can also have some effect

50
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,710
on as we can help people to do bulk updates of the names,

51
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,270
which is really difficult

52
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:07,890
through the DHIS2 user interface.

53
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,940
Once again, something like a data dictionary

54
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,610
would also be very helpful here

55
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,930
if it&#39;s available because things like definitions

56
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,310
and descriptions can be taken directly

57
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:17,500
from those data dictionaries

58
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:20,980
and added to our descriptions in DHIS2.

59
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,130
So if we want to see if two objects

60
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,240
are actually the same, we can refer back

61
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,980
to the description and seeing,

62
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,350
in order to see if this is actually representing

63
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,870
the same item and if they need to be collapsed

64
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,063
later on eventually.

65
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,860
We can also look at things like metadata duplicates.

66
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,790
And I&#39;ve talked about this already

67
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:42,150
in quite some detail just by going through

68
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,830
the user interface and trying to identify

69
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,010
if what we&#39;re seeing is duplicated in several places.

70
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,600
Things like indicators, data elements,

71
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,960
and all this stuff around categories

72
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,410
are some examples where we can just kind of go through

73
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:57,770
the user interface and do some type of assessment.

74
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,500
So we&#39;ll talk about this a little bit more

75
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,820
in terms of the results of this process.

76
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,520
And what we might need to do

77
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,393
when we find a lot of these errors.

78
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,960
We also want to describe some other tools

79
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,940
that could be used to assess DHIS2 design.

80
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,640
And this includes a data integrity checks

81
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,360
and a number of supplemental SQL scripts

82
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,160
that are also available to perform

83
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,563
some initial assessment of the database design.

84
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,790
Now I put here in the loop learning objectives

85
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,330
that we want you to be able to describe

86
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,930
the following only because if you&#39;re not comfortable

87
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,040
running an SQL script, for example,

88
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,420
all you need to know is that there are scripts available

89
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,860
and you can get the output of this

90
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:38,680
and maybe have one of your team members

91
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,750
kind of help you do these types of things.

92
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,910
So as long as you&#39;re aware

93
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,800
that some of these tools are available,

94
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,190
you can always kind of lean on them

95
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,560
and get someone else to kind of help you

96
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,033
implement them in practice.

97
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,010
So here&#39;s an example of the result

98
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,120
of a manual assessment in a live system.

99
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,150
And one thing that we have to be kind of cognizant of,

100
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,520
that we have to be thinking of,

101
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,110
basically whenever we&#39;re doing these types of reviews

102
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:08,230
is that there&#39;s often going to be significant pushback.

103
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,203
This type of activity is often difficult to explain,

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,380
but there is a huge impact on data quality

105
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:18,530
as we&#39;ve been discussing over the course

106
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:20,350
of these various sessions.

107
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:24,050
So what we see here is a number of metadata items.

108
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,540
And then in the first kind of significant column,

109
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,087
current system, is the actual system as it stands currently,

110
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,160
then what I have in the next box

111
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,170
is expected in new system.

112
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:41,170
So sometimes we have to actually rebuild

113
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,870
the database, you know?

114
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:47,240
And this is a big step and it&#39;s a very time consuming step

115
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,390
and it takes a lot of effort and resources to do,

116
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,680
but I wouldn&#39;t shy away necessarily

117
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,600
for making that recommendation.

118
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,040
If it is going to result

119
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,950
in significant usability changes

120
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,200
that would just make the system much easier to use,

121
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,740
make the data quality,

122
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,500
improve the data quality significantly

123
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,590
by collapsing various data elements

124
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,890
and getting the right value for them.

125
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:13,190
So now you&#39;re aware of what your source data elements are,

126
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,520
you&#39;re aware of what your desegregations are.

127
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,620
You&#39;re able to collapse these to be correct.

128
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:20,380
And users are only seeing one version

129
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,320
of these data elements,

130
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,230
of these desegregations in their system.

131
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,840
So they know they&#39;re can be confident

132
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,750
that they&#39;re selecting the right value

133
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,020
when they&#39;re making their outputs.

134
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,510
So this can be a bit challenging to go through

135
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,700
and actually come up with the results

136
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,320
and implement the solution,

137
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,260
but actually just going through it

138
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,780
and doing a manual review,

139
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,427
even without kind of saying,

140
00:05:41,427 --> 00:05:43,300
&quot;Okay, now I&#39;m going to actually implement

141
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,080
all of these changes in practice.&quot;

142
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,500
But just being able to identify

143
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:48,490
some of these things and show people

144
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,120
how this can have an effect

145
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,910
on what they&#39;re doing and maybe ease

146
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,110
some of their frustration by implementing

147
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,670
even some of these bandaid solutions

148
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,020
like category option groups and group sets

149
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,540
that kind of mask things from the user itself

150
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,820
can be hugely beneficial just by going through the system

151
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,820
and kind of having a look at how it&#39;s been built and set up.
