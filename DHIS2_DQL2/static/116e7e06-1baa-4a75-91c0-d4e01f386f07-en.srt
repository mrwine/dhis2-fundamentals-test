00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,680
- [Instructor] So in this discussion,

1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,450
we&#39;re going to talk about DHIS2 system design

2
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,420
and how it affects data quality.

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,370
We&#39;re going to go through a couple of different topics

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:11,950
and we&#39;ll split this up into multiple sessions

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,593
just to kind of have these segmented by thematic area.

6
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,110
In this presentation,

7
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,560
we&#39;re going to discuss a couple of different ways

8
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:28,360
we can look at the inputs of our DHIS2 system

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,730
and how this ends up affecting data quality.

10
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:34,730
So the first thing we&#39;re going to look at is form design.

11
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:38,090
And I will just emphasize that we&#39;re talking about

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:40,750
aggregate form design in this scenario.

13
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,920
There&#39;s a lot about tracker that can also be discussed,

14
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,520
but in this particular case, just due to time restrictions,

15
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,640
we&#39;re not going to focus on that too much.

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,330
However, when we get to the other parts of the discussion,

17
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:53,470
database and metadata design

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,490
and the functions to assess databases and metadata design,

19
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,593
we will be discussing tracker as well.

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,310
So the other topics we have for database and metadata design

21
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:06,570
and functions to assess databases and metadata design,

22
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,650
first, we&#39;ll talk about the databases and metadata design

23
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,590
a little bit, in a little bit of detail,

24
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,620
and actually I&#39;ve separated this out

25
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,870
into two separate components.

26
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:17,900
The first thing that I&#39;m going to talk about is things that

27
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,930
we more or less have some control over.

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:25,920
So some customization challenges that we actually can modify

29
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,470
and have a great deal of impact on usability of the system

30
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:33,410
in terms of reviewing data and getting the data we need.

31
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:36,480
Then the second part of this is some challenges that we

32
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,650
have a little less control over currently,

33
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:40,776
just based upon the limitations of

34
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:42,710
the DHIS2 maintenance app.

35
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,350
So there&#39;s a lot of things we might be able to do

36
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,270
to get around this,

37
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:47,750
maybe running SQL queries

38
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,730
or accessing things through the API

39
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:51,980
and making modifications that way.

40
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,790
But then, if we&#39;re trying to build long-term capacity,

41
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:56,670
it becomes quite challenging to do this

42
00:01:56,670 --> 00:02:00,360
if there&#39;s no real good way to do some things in DHIS2

43
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,060
to deal with some of these issues.

44
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:04,870
Lastly, we&#39;re going to talk about functions

45
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,770
to assess databases and metadata design.

46
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,350
So we&#39;re actually going to discuss some ways to deal with

47
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:14,480
these problems or at least assess these problems.

48
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,020
We&#39;re going to be presenting a number of problems, actually,

49
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,310
over the course of this discussion.

50
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:22,480
And we do want to kind of also provide some tools

51
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,310
to actually rectify the situation

52
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,160
when you find something that&#39;s wrong.

53
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,230
Okay, so the first kind of session that we&#39;ll have

54
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:36,830
is focusing on aggregate form design.

55
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:37,890
And we&#39;re going to talk about

56
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,620
a couple of different things here.

57
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:43,040
First, we&#39;ll talk about poor form source design.

58
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,660
So, when you&#39;re actually having a paper form that

59
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,270
really has a lot of problems with it and what you do.

60
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,590
And we&#39;re actually going to talk about

61
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,720
a couple of different kinds of aspects of this

62
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,350
as we go through the session.

63
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,490
We&#39;re going to talk about incorrect disaggregations

64
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:58,410
on these forms as well as duplicate variables

65
00:02:58,410 --> 00:02:59,940
and duplicate variables happen

66
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,560
in a lot of different scenarios.

67
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,830
This includes within the same form itself,

68
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:06,830
across different forms, between different programs,

69
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:10,230
and across different forms in the same program itself.

70
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:11,760
So we&#39;ll break each of these down

71
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,410
as we go through this discussion.

72
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,690
So the first thing I&#39;m going to talk about

73
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:21,640
is just some basics on poor form source design in general.

74
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,060
And if we look at this form,

75
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,820
it&#39;s a form that&#39;s collecting delivery services,

76
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,070
essentially, antenatal care delivery parity

77
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,940
and have a look at the disaggregations.

78
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,490
Just think for a second what might be off

79
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,840
when you look at this form.

80
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,760
So this is based on a real paper form.

81
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,530
This is not something I just made up

82
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,990
for the sake of providing a poor example.

83
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,353
But if we have a look,

84
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,710
we have male here recorded for all these services

85
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,290
and that doesn&#39;t make any sense at all, right?

86
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,980
So we cannot actually record anything

87
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,530
for the male sex disaggregation.

88
00:03:55,530 --> 00:03:56,630
So it shouldn&#39;t be there.

89
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,110
We don&#39;t need the sex disaggregation applied

90
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:01,510
to these age disaggregations at all.

91
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,430
And the problem with this,

92
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,920
it results in data being entered

93
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,530
that is subsequently incorrect, right?

94
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,770
So we might have information entered for males,

95
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:14,030
and we&#39;re not actually sure what to do with that.

96
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:15,660
Is this an incorrect value?

97
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,330
Should this go in the female disaggregation?

98
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,750
Should this be removed entirely?

99
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,620
And what happens in this scenario is,

100
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,050
we&#39;re not actually sure when we go to review

101
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,070
our data quality, why our numbers look incorrect,

102
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:30,944
or we&#39;re just reviewing our data and we&#39;re not actually

103
00:04:30,944 --> 00:04:34,700
even aware of how this is affecting our final output.

104
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,970
And we&#39;re just kind of reporting the values that have been

105
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,880
recorded in that female disaggregation

106
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,920
and not really doing anything with the values

107
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,081
that have been recorded in that male disaggregation.

108
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,480
So it&#39;s just something to be wary of

109
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,840
when we&#39;re thinking about how we design systems

110
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,420
and how this affects our final data output, actually,

111
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,913
because it can have quite a deleterious effect

112
00:04:53,913 --> 00:04:57,500
on our information because just giving us the wrong output,

113
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,760
the wrong values, our data quality is affected.

114
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Our outputs are all affected with wrong values, essentially.
