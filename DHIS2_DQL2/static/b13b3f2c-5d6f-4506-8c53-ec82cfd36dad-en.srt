00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:02,900
- [Scott] All right, so now we are gonna take a quick look

1
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,150
at how we are able to,

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:05,983
within

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:12,470
Tracker programs, perform some data quality checks.

4
00:00:14,439 --> 00:00:16,889
And a quick overview, we&#39;ve just talked about the

5
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:20,680
Tracker to Aggregate approaches.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,420
Let&#39;s talk about then some common issues with data quality

7
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:24,970
in patient records.

8
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:27,620
Then I&#39;m gonna do a really brief overview of how we can

9
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,150
build out some program rules.

10
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,810
These are some logic rules that you can put into

11
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,170
Tracker programs for data quality checks.

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,970
This is not a Tracker academy,

13
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:40,280
we have academies specifically on building out

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,010
Tracker programs, and goes into a lot of detail

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,710
on how to build out program rules.

16
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,260
I strongly encourage you to go to one of those

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,580
to get a very detailed overview or skill set

18
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,440
of actually how to do this.

19
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,100
I&#39;m gonna give you some really basic overview just now.

20
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,880
And then we&#39;re gonna talk a little bit about

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,370
how we can monitor completeness through program indicators.

22
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:02,960
Again, I&#39;m not gonna go into detail

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,630
on how to build program indicators,

24
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:07,190
there&#39;s another academy for that, but I&#39;m just gonna

25
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:08,970
give you a brief overview on how they can be applied

26
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,690
for data quality.

27
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,960
So let&#39;s talk about

28
00:01:13,832 --> 00:01:17,420
some common issues with data in Tracker programs.

29
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:21,820
Most of us are building very complex data entry forms

30
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,370
in Tracker.

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,760
We&#39;re doing the same thing in Aggregate as well.

32
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,310
And we&#39;re not building in a lot of workflow support

33
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,430
to these forms.

34
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,840
It&#39;s a problem in Aggregate.

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,913
It&#39;s even a bigger problem in Tracker.

36
00:01:35,037 --> 00:01:36,970
So if we&#39;re capturing individual patient data,

37
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,710
we have got to put in a lot of workflow support.

38
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:41,360
I&#39;ll give you an example of that.

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,360
Then, there&#39;s often a lot of questions,

40
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,803
can we calculate coverages based upon Tracker data only?

41
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,460
The general rule of thumb is, probably not.

42
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:54,920
You probably don&#39;t have the entire population coverage

43
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:57,256
using just your Tracker program.

44
00:01:57,256 --> 00:02:00,400
So how do we then calculate coverage based upon

45
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,990
our Tracker data or in combination of

46
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,962
Tracker and Aggregate data?

47
00:02:03,962 --> 00:02:05,620
And then calculating completeness

48
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,800
from individual patient records.

49
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,890
Another tricky thing is,

50
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,690
when is a patient actually complete?

51
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,610
All right, let&#39;s first go into that workflow question.

52
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,050
How do we address that with program rules?

53
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:19,360
Well, it&#39;s actually easier for me to show you

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,690
than to go through it.

55
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,440
I&#39;m gonna give you a quick example.

56
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:27,040
You&#39;re looking at a DHIS2 database

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,480
for Mass Drug Administration.

58
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,700
And what they are actually doing is they are using

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,630
Events to capture Mass Drug Administration,

60
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:41,170
so Mass Drug Campaigns.

61
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:43,293
So I&#39;m gonna go into the Capture App,

62
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,910
and this is not a demo database,

63
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,210
this is actually a database from a real project,

64
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,480
so you&#39;re not able to go into this one,

65
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,880
but I&#39;m just gonna show it to you as an example.

66
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,810
And then I&#39;m going to go into an org unit,

67
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:01,860
and I&#39;m gonna select one of my programs.

68
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:03,123
This is the Capture App.

69
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,810
Again, this is a different app in data entry.

70
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:08,610
I&#39;m gonna select one of my programs,

71
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,390
this is an Event program, I&#39;m gonna click New Event.

72
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:19,390
So now I&#39;m opened a data entry form for an Event Program.

73
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,433
In this case, it&#39;s a Mass Drug Administration for LF.

74
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:30,659
LF is lymphatic filariasis, which is a parasite drug.

75
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,310
If you&#39;re doing MDA, is Mass Drug Administration

76
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,710
for this particular disease.

77
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,210
And what I&#39;m gonna start doing is putting in

78
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,670
some data here, just to show you some of the warnings

79
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:47,003
that pop up as I&#39;m putting this data in.

80
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,970
Can just put in a contract ID,

81
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,977
implementation total persons, 10,

82
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,070
Here&#39;s the first example of workflow support.

83
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,363
So in Programs,

84
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:09,290
I can put in questions that if I answer,

85
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,790
will prompt additional questions.

86
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,223
Again, workflow support.

87
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:18,060
We want to build in as much workflow support.

88
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,580
As you&#39;re filling out questions,

89
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,770
you want to be able to hide certain answers,

90
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:23,730
or you want to be able to show other questions,

91
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,090
based upon a certain answer.

92
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,927
So in this box, I have a tick box that says &quot;Yes,&quot;

93
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:29,810
and if I do that, then it opens another

94
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,260
field that I need to fill in.

95
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,510
Okay.

96
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,513
I&#39;m just gonna start putting in more information here.

97
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,200
And this next question is a good one.

98
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,930
So we say &quot;Year Started,&quot; so here I should

99
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,660
be putting in a year value.

100
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,660
I&#39;m gonna put in

101
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,780
a number that&#39;s not a year, and look what happens.

102
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:56,490
So I put in what, like 200,000?

103
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:58,830
We&#39;re not even close to the year 200,000 yet, right?

104
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,663
And so it says,

105
00:04:59,663 --> 00:05:03,790
&quot;Invalid year, this year must be between 1990 and 2020.&quot;

106
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:08,570
So if I go to 2000, see the warning goes away.

107
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,203
This is a great example of a simple program rule,

108
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,190
where if I put in a number that doesn&#39;t make sense,

109
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,160
it&#39;s checking the value that I&#39;m putting in,

110
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,350
and it&#39;s telling me in real time,

111
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,063
if this is an appropriate number.

112
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,620
I&#39;m gonna put in just a couple of more.

113
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:36,584
All right.

114
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:38,420
So I&#39;m just putting in random numbers right now,

115
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,900
and you can see I&#39;ve triggered another data quality check.

116
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,970
So in this case, what is it saying?

117
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,420
Well, I&#39;ve actually got an error box

118
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,890
in the top right corner here.

119
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,160
And it says &quot;Persons targeted cannot be greater than

120
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:51,220
the population eligible for PC.&quot;

121
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,683
PC is a treatment process.

122
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:58,880
And here they say, okay, look, I&#39;ve got 10 here.

123
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,970
And it says, &quot;Persons targeted

124
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,010
cannot be greater than pop-&quot;

125
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:01,940
And then it&#39;s telling me,

126
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,770
okay, check here, check here, check here.

127
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,840
And great, so I have 10 here, but I have 10 there,

128
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,090
but this is saying it&#39;s not right.

129
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:12,250
So if I just put in zero and zero,

130
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,790
great, now it goes away.

131
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,133
So the sum of these could not be greater than this.

132
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,100
And that&#39;s what it was, so when I put it in the zeros,

133
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:20,933
it went away.

134
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,570
All right, now I&#39;ve got another data quality check.

135
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:30,437
I just put in some more random numbers, it&#39;s saying,

136
00:06:30,437 --> 00:06:32,363
&quot;The sum of male plus female treated

137
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:35,140
can not be greater than the sum of PreSAC, SAC

138
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,280
and adults targeted.&quot;

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,320
So these are aged breakdowns,

140
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,873
and it&#39;s saying the sum of male and female treated

141
00:06:40,873 --> 00:06:43,670
can not be greater than these values here.

142
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,850
So what did I do, I put in 10 male plus 10 female,

143
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:51,640
that&#39;s 20, and then the sum of this is just 10, right?

144
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,340
So let&#39;s try to fix that.

145
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,130
I&#39;ll put in zero here.

146
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,430
Great, now that went away.

147
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,570
I just put in some more random numbers and guess what?

148
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:06,660
I got two more errors saying, &quot;The sum of male and females

149
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:09,690
should be equal to sum of treated,&quot; okay?

150
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,570
So they&#39;re saying that this sum, male/female

151
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:14,440
should also be equal to the sum of these three.

152
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,090
And then it&#39;s saying also, &quot;The sum of Pre-SAC, SAC,

153
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:20,530
treated cannot be greater than the sum of Pre-SAC targeted.&quot;

154
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:24,300
So they&#39;re saying this sum cannot be greater than this sum.

155
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,623
So let me go in and fix that.

156
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,833
All right, so now all my data quality checks went away.

157
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,570
So I just wanted to give you a quick demonstration

158
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:41,140
of program rules in action.

159
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,960
So this is a real project.

160
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,870
They&#39;re entering data across dozens of countries

161
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,340
actually in this particular program,

162
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,936
hundreds of people are entering data using

163
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:51,270
this particular reporting form.

164
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,930
And you can see all of the various data quality checks

165
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,890
are just an example of some of the data quality checks

166
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,710
that are coming up, as they&#39;re putting the data in.

167
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:00,630
You can also see some of the workflow support.

168
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,500
So for example, I ask a question, if I say &quot;Yes,&quot;

169
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:06,980
then it gives me another box to fill out.

170
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,923
These are done via program rules.

171
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,500
So let me get back to my PowerPoint presentation.

172
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,840
All those different data quality checks

173
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:21,150
that you&#39;ve just seen are done via program rules in DHIS2.

174
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,710
So essentially, what is a program rule?

175
00:08:24,710 --> 00:08:27,590
A program rule allows you to

176
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,570
put in dynamic behaviors in response to user input.

177
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,350
So just as you saw, I was ticking boxes and more things

178
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:36,980
were coming up, or I was putting in values

179
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:40,150
and it was causing alerts and error warnings.

180
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,820
You know, that&#39;s the kind of dynamic behaviors

181
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,820
we&#39;re talking about.

182
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:50,160
It allows you to send a lot of direct user feedback.

183
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,987
So as you&#39;re putting stuff in, you&#39;re telling the user,

184
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:55,180
&quot;No, that doesn&#39;t make sense&quot; or &quot;You need to check this,&quot;

185
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,107
or &quot;Those numbers can&#39;t add up.&quot;

186
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,623
And you are building these out as expressions.

187
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,570
We&#39;ll talk a little bit about the expression builder

188
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:06,620
just in a second here,

189
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,040
but essentially these expression builders have

190
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,770
a lot of different options for you.

191
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:14,210
It&#39;s not just about showing warnings or errors

192
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:16,030
or tick boxes, what I showed you,

193
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,090
there&#39;s lots of things that this can do.

194
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,673
And again, there&#39;s a whole academy that goes over this,

195
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,480
but just to make the point that

196
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,460
you can really tailor these messages, these warnings,

197
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:32,083
this user feedback, this workflow support,

198
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:37,633
to using a lot of different features.

199
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,390
Most actions using program rules will happen immediately

200
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,130
when the data values are entered.

201
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,220
So that&#39;s exactly what you saw me doing.

202
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,650
So as I was putting the values in,

203
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,750
there was something happening immediately.

204
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:58,723
And that program rule, in terms of how it&#39;s configured,

205
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,080
constitutes three things, variables, expressions,

206
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,113
and actions.

207
00:10:05,777 --> 00:10:07,777
I&#39;m gonna go through these very quickly.

208
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:12,710
Again, to get more detailed answers and explanations,

209
00:10:17,692 --> 00:10:19,390
we&#39;ll have to point you to another academy,

210
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,160
or certainly you can ask questions and we have

211
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,510
lots of resources for this.

212
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,430
So what are programs variables?

213
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,170
Essentially program variables

214
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,130
represent attributes and data element values,

215
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,000
which can be evaluated as part of an expression.

216
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,250
So essentially these are the data elements and

217
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,847
attributes that you actually define.

218
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,983
Usually they&#39;re data elements, sometimes they&#39;re attributes.

219
00:10:54,290 --> 00:10:55,190
Once you make them

220
00:10:56,873 --> 00:11:00,233
as a variable, you can use them in multiple program rules.

221
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,740
This can include data values and attributes,

222
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,853
and operate these as expressions.

223
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,493
Let me kind of skip through that.

224
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,870
Here&#39;s the screen if you want to make

225
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,580
a program rule variable.

226
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,590
This is really the first step,

227
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,890
you have to define the variables,

228
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,450
then you can put them into your expressions.

229
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,770
And then from your expressions, you define the actions.

230
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:29,120
So in this case, we&#39;re looking at a program variable

231
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,780
called Sex, and the sex is a tracked entity attribute.

232
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,580
So this is like if you have a patient and the patient

233
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,890
is male or female, then this would be

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,583
sex that they&#39;re using here.

235
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:47,950
The expression is the next star,

236
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,430
so once you&#39;ve defined your program rule variables,

237
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,120
you have to define your expressions,

238
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,920
and your expressions are essentially

239
00:11:55,688 --> 00:11:58,703
the logic that is being applied to,

240
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:04,131
or it&#39;s defining the kind of interaction that

241
00:12:04,131 --> 00:12:06,981
is happening based upon the value that are being entered.

242
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,083
So I&#39;ll skip through that.

243
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,030
In the expression you have to build out operators,

244
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,790
again, we don&#39;t have time to go over this

245
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:23,240
in a lot of detail.

246
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,240
There are clear documentations linked here,

247
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,133
in the PowerPoint, providing you what these are.

248
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,360
You have to do a little bit of programming,

249
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,750
and it&#39;s not programming in like you have to know JavaScript

250
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,230
or HTML or something like that,

251
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:39,890
but there&#39;s just syntax in which you have to build out

252
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,523
these program rule expressions in.

253
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,380
And you can see here, I won&#39;t go over

254
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,570
each one of these examples, but you can see that they

255
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:49,120
can become actually very complex.

256
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,240
There&#39;s a lot of flexibility here on what you can actually

257
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,050
do with the program rule expressions.

258
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,297
So you can say like,

259
00:12:58,297 --> 00:13:00,897
&quot;If&quot; statements or &quot;Greater than&quot; statements, or

260
00:13:00,897 --> 00:13:03,740
&quot;Or&quot; statements, &quot;And&quot; statements,

261
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,850
you can really, really build some complicated things here.

262
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,243
You know, of course it&#39;s better to keep stuff simple.

263
00:13:10,421 --> 00:13:12,343
But you can, say like,

264
00:13:14,787 --> 00:13:17,540
&quot;If they enter sex as male, if they enter age

265
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:22,070
as greater than 35, if they enter BMI as this,

266
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,477
then recommend this action.&quot;

267
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,830
You can really base these program rules,

268
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:30,410
based upon multiple variables

269
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,760
and give specific feedback as the data&#39;s coming in.

270
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,860
Not useful for just data quality,

271
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,943
also useful for just workflow support.

272
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:41,530
Custom functions,

273
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,830
I&#39;m not gonna go over this, but just suffice to say

274
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:49,370
that you can build out various custom functions.

275
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,040
So you can count the number of days in a month,

276
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,440
you can count the number of days between events.

277
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,860
You can prompt actions if there&#39;s a specific value,

278
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,070
we call these our d2 Functions, you can see that

279
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,920
on the left side of the column there.

280
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,160
That&#39;s just an example.

281
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,740
All right so, actions.

282
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,960
So we defined our variables, we defined our expression,

283
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,650
and then we can define many different actions

284
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,730
that they have.

285
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,200
In the example that I showed you,

286
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,750
the action that I was triggering was &quot;Show warnings,&quot;

287
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,830
and &quot;Show an error.&quot;

288
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,120
So you saw that as I entered values,

289
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,100
and there was data quality checks happening,

290
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,813
it was popping up different errors saying,

291
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:32,963
these values don&#39;t sum up together,

292
00:14:34,384 --> 00:14:36,590
you need to double-check this.

293
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:39,340
There are many different actions that could happen.

294
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,733
So I was just showing you basically one action.

295
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,810
You can check the docs here, if you

296
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:47,110
click on this actions icon, it&#39;ll take you to the docs

297
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,650
and all the various actions.

298
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,000
There&#39;s really a lot of different choices here.

299
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,810
So this is a brief summary.

300
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,220
So you enter the program rule details,

301
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:59,070
then you enter your program rule expression,

302
00:14:59,070 --> 00:15:01,033
and then you define your actions.

303
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,030
The other thing that I want to point out is that

304
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:12,900
many of you are using Android, the mobile app,

305
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,900
to be able to capture Tracker data as well now.

306
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,100
So you&#39;re not just using your PCs,

307
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,274
or you actually have folks in the field,

308
00:15:23,274 --> 00:15:24,370
community health workers, outreach workers,

309
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:26,900
clinicians, that are using the application.

310
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,580
The point to be made about folks that are using

311
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,100
the application is, as they&#39;re filling out data,

312
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,740
make it as easy as possible.

313
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,170
Put in pictures, make different colors,

314
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,070
make it so that each one of the answers

315
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:40,680
to each one of the questions is clear and distinct.

316
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,110
So here you see an example of a malaria program

317
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,460
where a community health worker

318
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,240
is filling out malaria cases.

319
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,140
And you can see that for the answers

320
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,550
in the top right corner,

321
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,040
it&#39;s saying &quot;How did you diagnose this malaria test,

322
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,680
did you use microscopy, an RDT,

323
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,050
or there was no test at all?&quot;

324
00:15:57,050 --> 00:15:59,800
And you can see that there&#39;s pictures,

325
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,890
there&#39;s clear colors.

326
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:03,850
It&#39;s very simple, even for someone who may be illiterate

327
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:06,107
to answer this question, right?

328
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:07,347
&quot;Which one did you use?&quot;

329
00:16:08,324 --> 00:16:10,340
And again, this is the best practice,

330
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:13,260
the best practice is make it as clear and simple as possible

331
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:16,140
for folks to be able to enter this data.

332
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,680
The next question of course is,

333
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,570
or a later question is, &quot;What are the treatment types?&quot;

334
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,573
And again, very clear, pictures different colors,

335
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,500
and so they would be able to distinguish

336
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,213
which treatment type that they provided.

337
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,350
So program indicators are another way in which we&#39;re able

338
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:43,260
to calculate values based upon Tracker data.

339
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,484
Many of you may be wondering what&#39;s the difference

340
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:47,750
between a standard indicator and a program indicator.

341
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,480
The main difference is that a program indicator

342
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,860
can have a little bit more logic put into it,

343
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:57,440
and it calculates values based within a single program.

344
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,440
Whereas a standard indicator cannot support much logic,

345
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,890
but it can calculate values across multiple programs

346
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,170
or multiple data sets.

347
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,413
Okay?

348
00:17:09,413 --> 00:17:10,690
So a standard indicator,

349
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,910
across multiple programs or data sets,

350
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:16,470
and a program indicator, you can add more expressions,

351
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,370
more logic to it, but it can only calculate

352
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,693
within a single program.

353
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,430
So here&#39;s an example of program indicators

354
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,050
that look at completeness of data that&#39;s entered

355
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,950
in Tracker programs.

356
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,358
Two examples here, the first one is

357
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:35,120
&quot;Count of BCG doses given, divided by total number

358
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,820
of tracked children,&quot; right?

359
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,830
So what is that giving us?

360
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:41,239
That&#39;s giving us basically a coverage of BCG doses

361
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:43,130
across all of the children

362
00:17:44,588 --> 00:17:47,580
that we have captured data against in our Tracker program.

363
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,990
A very simple program indicator,

364
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,490
may be applicable to like an immunization program.

365
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:55,340
The second example here is, &quot;Return the percentage

366
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:59,830
of tracked children who have recoded a BCG dose.&quot;

367
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:03,754
So tell me the percentage of children that have

368
00:18:03,754 --> 00:18:05,243
received a BCG dose.

369
00:18:07,974 --> 00:18:11,500
So this is very simple examples of how we&#39;re able

370
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,210
to actually look at something like BCG dose

371
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:18,128
completeness within a Tracker program.

372
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:27,940
So the question becomes,

373
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,050
a lot of times is,

374
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,630
if we have Tracker data and we have Aggregate data,

375
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:35,633
how do we combine those into a single coverage indicator?

376
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:42,110
What we typically recommend is that you do not use

377
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:45,400
Tracker data as your sole denominator

378
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,703
for coverage indicators.

379
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,640
Why is that?

380
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,060
Because typically most Tracker programs

381
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,030
do not have national coverage.

382
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,890
Meaning that most of them are still in some stage

383
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,350
of scaling or pilot.

384
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,684
So maybe you have a couple of districts using Tracker

385
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:03,517
and they are

386
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,740
capturing individual

387
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,700
service data through Tracker,

388
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,010
but then you have other districts

389
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:14,150
that are maybe not using Tracker,

390
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,820
or they&#39;re not using it as well.

391
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,220
And they&#39;re still capturing that Aggregated data

392
00:19:19,145 --> 00:19:21,273
on a monthly basis or something.

393
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,250
So how do you actually then

394
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,410
make, say like a national coverage indicator?

395
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,350
Well, you need to potentially combine

396
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:36,100
the two sources of data together into a standard indicator,

397
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,210
but we don&#39;t recommend that you necessarily

398
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:41,285
solely use Tracker data, unless you know that you have

399
00:19:41,285 --> 00:19:43,840
a hundred percent coverage of your Tracker program

400
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,140
across the entire country.

401
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:52,040
Let me just kind of skip to the point here.

402
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:56,790
So here we have kind of,

403
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,900
what&#39;s the good practice,

404
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,910
the best practice is to have

405
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,700
two different indicators, potentially.

406
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,980
So you have your national coverage,

407
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,100
that&#39;s using your Aggregate denominator,

408
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,150
and then you have another coverage that&#39;s using

409
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:10,700
Tracker data.

410
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:13,040
And you&#39;re able to see those side by side.

411
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,603
And so that&#39;s what we&#39;re actually able to look at here.

412
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,320
We have the coverage indicators on the left

413
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,660
that are coming from the Tracker program,

414
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:27,200
and then we have the individual data that&#39;s coming from

415
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,153
the Aggregate side.

416
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:39,156
You can see in the green is the Tracker coverage.

417
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,930
The blue is the national coverage coming from the Aggregate.

418
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,570
So you&#39;re able to see those side-by-side.

419
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,920
And then the same thing on the right side,

420
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,520
the green is the total number of immunized children,

421
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,370
and the blue is coming from your Aggregate data

422
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:01,220
and the blue is the total number of children

423
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,410
registered in the immunization program.

424
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:05,030
So you&#39;re able to see these side by side.

425
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,360
Again, the point being that, you know,

426
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,250
as it stands right now, the general recommendation

427
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:13,180
is you put your Tracker data alongside

428
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,263
your Aggregate data.

429
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,693
And view these as somewhat distinct,

430
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:23,810
unless you know that you have a hundred percent coverage

431
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,453
of your Tracker program, which is quite rare.

432
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,530
All right, just one other slide here.

433
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,523
Sorry.

434
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:45,200
Here we want to talk about how you monitor Aggregate data

435
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,380
compiled from a Tracker program to ensure that errors

436
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,623
have not occurred in the data transfer.

437
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,884
Essentially what we&#39;re looking for

438
00:21:52,884 --> 00:21:54,240
is a one-to-one relationship.

439
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,240
So what we are saying is that, Yuri just talked through

440
00:22:02,844 --> 00:22:05,160
some of the tools that can be used for this,

441
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,510
but you also want to put in

442
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:12,300
some program indicators to make sure

443
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,901
that the values are being transferred.

444
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:18,390
So for example, if I am transferring this month&#39;s

445
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:20,570
Tracker data into Aggregate,

446
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:24,470
let&#39;s make a program indicator that sums up

447
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,340
all of the Tracker data for that data element

448
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:30,300
for that month, right?

449
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,280
And then let&#39;s see that program indicator,

450
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,280
and then when we push the data from Tracker to Aggregate,

451
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:42,040
let&#39;s make sure that that data element that we see

452
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:46,220
in our Aggregate is the same as that program indicator.

453
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,053
Right?

454
00:22:47,053 --> 00:22:48,680
So we can double check this.

455
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,270
So we make sure that we kind of have

456
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,230
a one-to-one relationship.

457
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,118
Sometimes it can become quite problematic

458
00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:56,418
with the transfer process,

459
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,470
if you don&#39;t have these data quality checks

460
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:03,570
in place to monitor just the transfer,

461
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,820
did everything actually go through correctly.

462
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,253
Okay.

463
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,980
I think I&#39;m gonna skip the last slide.

464
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,060
Actually, Yuri covered it quite thoroughly, I think.

465
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:20,190
And so that brings us, time now is 12:06 Oslo time.

466
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:23,163
So we are gonna go ahead and take our break.

467
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,310
Well, let&#39;s see if there&#39;s any questions, Nora,

468
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,383
any questions from the community, Martin?

469
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,060
- [Nora] Scott, you answered the questions about Excel

470
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,930
into Tracker, and then there is a question from Dhruvee,

471
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:49,130
again, if we calculate coverage, if we use Event Program

472
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:52,670
to do surveys of representative samples,

473
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:55,200
using it for a annual household survey

474
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,793
to calculate coverage.

475
00:23:58,605 --> 00:23:59,580
I&#39;m not sure.

476
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,183
And there&#39;s also another question from Rose.

477
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,910
- [Scott] So can we calculate coverage if we&#39;re using data

478
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:13,328
to do surveys of representative samples?

479
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:16,910
Yeah, of course you can,

480
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:19,150
what we were talking about, and I think that seems like

481
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,580
maybe a lower level, like a DHS,

482
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,140
like a Demographic Household Survey or something like that.

483
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,330
You certainly can do that,

484
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,550
and that&#39;s the methodology that DHS also employs.

485
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:31,760
What we were saying is that maybe for like

486
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:35,280
coverage indicators that are like total immunized

487
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,160
or percentage of immunized children,

488
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:40,700
or something like that, fully immunized children.

489
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,970
Typically we don&#39;t have Tracker programs yet

490
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,450
that are at national scale to be able to calculate

491
00:24:45,450 --> 00:24:47,310
that one with a hundred percent certainty

492
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:49,030
from just Tracker data.

493
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,560
But I think that if you&#39;re looking at coverage calculations

494
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,410
that are just from like maybe survey data

495
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:58,410
and you&#39;re using Event Capture to get that survey data,

496
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,160
then I think that&#39;s probably fine.

497
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:03,680
It&#39;s not so much associated with like

498
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,073
clinical service delivery.

499
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:08,217
And then Rose has a question here.

500
00:25:08,217 --> 00:25:11,050
&quot;Would it be possible to send program notifications and

501
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:13,690
Tracker Events as a full collective summary,

502
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:15,117
not as single notification?&quot;

503
00:25:18,781 --> 00:25:19,813
Yes, I think so.

504
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:29,743
Oh, you want to schedule notifications from Tracker?

505
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:33,800
I believe so.

506
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,053
So you also have something called program notifications,

507
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,770
that when you&#39;re actually building the program,

508
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,900
that you can apply.

509
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,910
And I think maybe not using a program rule,

510
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,100
but a program notification might be the answer to that.

511
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,166
But to be honest with you, Rose,

512
00:25:50,166 --> 00:25:53,600
I am not the world&#39;s expert on Tracker.

513
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,960
And so what we need to do is I need to pass

514
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,840
your question along to Yuri, who would have

515
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,393
a better answer than me, I hope.

516
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,533
All right, so now we&#39;re at 12:08.

517
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:11,080
If you were wondering if I could share with you

518
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:15,470
access to the database that I just did a quick demo,

519
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,313
I cannot.

520
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,100
That is a production instance developed by

521
00:26:20,949 --> 00:26:23,090
DHIS2 Implementer, that I asked if I could just do

522
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:25,280
a quick demo of their data capture forms,

523
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,219
and they said that was fine.

524
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:29,269
But it&#39;s not publicly available instance.

525
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:36,630
Okay, so let us take our 15 minute break

526
00:26:36,630 --> 00:26:41,630
and we will be then coming back now at, I guess it would be

527
00:26:43,591 --> 00:26:44,453
12:25.

528
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:49,300
Nora, would that give us sufficient time to go through

529
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,800
your session after the break?

530
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,780
- [Nora] Yes, Scott that&#39;s fine.

531
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,170
We&#39;ve just had a request for the uploading of the

532
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,003
PowerPoint presentations piece.

533
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:03,870
- [Scott] Right, I believe mine is already uploaded,

534
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:06,322
but we need to grab Yuri&#39;s as well.

535
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:10,520
- [Nora] Yes, then 12:25, we will meet again.

536
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,900
- [Scott] Okay, great.

537
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:15,153
We&#39;ll see you back here in 15 minutes at 12:25 Oslo time.
