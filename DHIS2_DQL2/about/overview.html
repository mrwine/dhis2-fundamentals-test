  <h3>About This Course</h3>
<p>Reliable and quality data are used to plan, monitor, evaluate and strengthen health system performance, as well as to make evidence-informed decisions. However, ensuring good data quality can often be an issue across large Health Information Systems, especially if users and administrators are unaware of the tools available, and the frameworks they can use.</p>
<p>With this self-paced Data Quality Academy, you will learn how to assess and improve data quality in DHIS2 and prepare the data for information needs. After completing this course, youâ€™ll be able to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Verify data quality using the Completeness, Consistency - Time, Consistency - Data,  and Outliers dashboards inside the WHO Data Quality Tool</li>
<li>Create notifications using the DHIS2 Data Quality App to monitor and improve data quality</li>
<li>Identify the steps to create a program rule for good data quality when importing Tracker data to Aggregate data sets</li>
<li>Examine the processes and best practices associated with data capture that impact data quality, such as form design, naming conventions, and metadata, data elements value types, maintenance, and organisation units management</li>
<li>Install and configure the WHO Data Quality Tool</li>
</ul>
<p>This Academy targets advanced users of DHIS2. Prior experience with DHIS2 is required. </p>
