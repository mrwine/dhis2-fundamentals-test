<h3>Use Case: Sri Lanka</h3>
<p>In this video, Pamod Amarakoon from HISP Sri Lanka will explain how through digital transformation, Sri Lanka managed to move from paper-based data collection system to a digital one using DHIS2, while keeping good data quality intact. You’ll first look at an example from Sri Lanka’s RMNCAYH (Reproductive, Maternal, Neonatal, Child, Adolescent and Youth Health) program, and then review an example from their Nutrition Monitoring program. Pamod will also discuss some of the best practices for digitally transforming your data capture process.</p>

<p>At the end of the video, Pamod takes questions from the audience of the session.</p>
