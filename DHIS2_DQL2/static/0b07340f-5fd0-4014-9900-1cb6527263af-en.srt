1
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,870
- [Instructor] In this video I&#39;m going to present

2
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:14,870
how to use the consistency data tab of the dashboard

3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:18,233
of the WHO Data Quality tool.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,133
Let&#39;s click on the consistency data tab.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,193
For the presentation,

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,893
let&#39;s set data to core, periods to June,

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,670
and organization units to national,

8
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,470
with this aggregation to district.

9
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,073
Set this way.

10
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:44,020
The screens that you will see

11
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,793
will match up with the screenshots in the guide.

12
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,160
We can enlarge the chart

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,223
by making the settings window disappear.

14
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:01,480
And let&#39;s scroll down and look at the charts

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,173
that appear on the consistency data tab.

16
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,783
There are three of them.

17
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:13,890
There are two scatter plots

18
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:20,770
and then a third chart that shows a series of histograms

19
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,223
or bar charts with a bar for each district.

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:31,503
Let&#39;s begin by looking at the two scatter plots.

21
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,550
The first of these compares

22
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:41,600
the district value of ANC first visits

23
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:48,160
to the district value of ANC fourth visits.

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,970
Again, with a scatter plot like this,

25
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:55,580
each dot represents the values for one district.

26
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,670
And you see that for most districts,

27
00:01:58,670 --> 00:02:03,670
there is a relationship between ANC first visits

28
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:09,210
and ANC fourth visits that is represented by this dark line.

29
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:15,650
That isn&#39;t to say that ANC 1 is close to ANC 4

30
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:22,600
just that the ratio of between these two values

31
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:27,740
follows a slope that is given by this black line.

32
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:34,290
For example, if a district had 40,000 ANC first visits,

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,470
then it&#39;s likely to have somewhere

34
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:46,470
around 7,500 ANC fourth visits.

35
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,890
And most of the districts in the country

36
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:55,370
follow this relationship.

37
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:59,070
And therefore most of the districts have dots

38
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,723
that fall between these two gray lines.

39
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,543
There is however, an exception.

40
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:11,623
You see this diamond shape dot again for District B-2,

41
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,370
which had far more ANC first visits

42
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,200
during this 12 month period,

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,600
far more ANC first visits than ANC fourth visits.

44
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:26,260
In fact, if we look at that,

45
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,260
it is perhaps 20 times as many ANC first visits

46
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,100
as ANC fourth visits.

47
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,150
Whereas the districts down here may have

48
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,520
only five times as many ANC first visits

49
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,563
as ANC fourth visits.

50
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,860
Now let&#39;s think about it.

51
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:51,860
District B-2 we&#39;ve seen this district appear before,

52
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:57,170
and in fact, when we looked at the consistency time charts,

53
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,470
we saw that there was a facility in District B-2

54
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:08,170
which had greatly over reported ANC first visits

55
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,800
in January of 2020.

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:15,800
So we have a pretty good explanation for why it is

57
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,900
that ANC first visits might be so much greater

58
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,200
than ANC fourth visits

59
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,540
that this might be the result of the same error

60
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:30,143
made in the reporting of ANC first visits.

61
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,520
Let&#39;s scroll down to the second scatter plot.

62
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,520
And this shows the relationship of ANC first visits

63
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,080
this time to the number of first doses of Penta vaccine.

64
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,600
Well, you may be surprised at first

65
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,430
that there is any relationship at all,

66
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:56,700
but if you were told that this was a country

67
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,230
where in almost every district,

68
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,840
more than 90% of pregnant women

69
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,520
got at least one anti-natal care visit

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,010
and more than 90% of eligible infants

71
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,130
got their first dose of Penta vaccine,

72
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,540
you might begin to understand

73
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:19,540
why the number of ANC first visits for a district

74
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,450
is pretty closely related to

75
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:26,730
the number of first doses of Penta to the vaccine.

76
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:30,760
And you see that for almost all districts,

77
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,723
this relationship is followed closely.

78
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:37,880
And again, there are certain exceptions.

79
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,460
Here&#39;s another exception.

80
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,000
But the diamond shaped dot up here

81
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,600
is once again for District B-2.

82
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,120
And we ask ourselves,

83
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,160
why is the number of first antenatal care visits

84
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,680
for District B-2 so much greater

85
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,000
than the number of first two doses of Penta vaccine?

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Well, perhaps you can answered the question yourself by now.

87
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,460
But each of these diamond shaped dots

88
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,750
is worthy of some investigation

89
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:15,390
because the relationship between antenatal care first visits

90
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:18,090
and Penta first doses

91
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:23,063
doesn&#39;t follow what we see in these other districts.

92
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,940
Finally, we come to this last chart,

93
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:33,250
which is not a scatterplot,

94
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:38,250
but is a histogram showing one bar for each district.

95
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:44,403
And for most districts, the bars are blue.

96
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:48,740
These bars are showing the dropout rate

97
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,180
between Penta 1 and Penta 3.

98
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,660
What is the dropout rate?

99
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:59,060
The dropout rate is simply the percentage of infants

100
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,950
who got their first dose of Penta vaccine,

101
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:06,810
but who did not return for their third dose.

102
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,810
So since an infant needs to receive their first dose,

103
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,120
before they can receive their third dose,

104
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,270
we expect the dropout rate to be positive.

105
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,640
That is we expect the number of first doses of Penta vaccine

106
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:27,530
to be greater than the number of third doses.

107
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,780
But look here,

108
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:32,850
there are two districts where the dropout rate is negative

109
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:37,030
District A-2 and District A-3.

110
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,300
In both of these districts,

111
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,320
the number of third doses of Penta vaccine

112
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,310
was greater than the number of first doses of Penta vaccine

113
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:51,740
during the 12 month period shown here.

114
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:55,370
This warrants some further investigation,

115
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,370
is it because of over-reporting of third doses of Penta

116
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:03,010
by a single health facility,

117
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:07,820
which greatly over-reported third doses of Penta vaccine?

118
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,780
Or is it because many health facilities

119
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:14,310
in one of these districts or both of these districts

120
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:18,993
are consistently over reporting of Penta three doses?

121
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,700
We cannot answer the question with the dashboard.

122
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,780
We will see later how we can use the analysis function

123
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:32,640
and the data quality tool to investigate further

124
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,640
the phenomenon of negative dropout in these two districts.

125
00:08:37,905 --> 00:08:41,073
(gentle upbeat music)
