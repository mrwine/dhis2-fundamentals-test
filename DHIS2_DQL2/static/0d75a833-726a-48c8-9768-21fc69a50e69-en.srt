00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:03,370
- [Narrator] So I wanted to spend a bit of time

1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,930
discussing category options, categories,

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:09,940
category combinations, category option combinations,

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:13,810
category option groups and category option group sets.

4
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,500
Now that is a pretty big mouthful,

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:20,060
but actually, this model that we use to desegregate our data

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,600
has a lot of pitfalls if it&#39;s not managed correctly.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,170
This is something I think a lot of us

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,990
have a direct impact in influencing

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,060
because we&#39;re often helping people set up their systems,

10
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:33,880
deal with this, set up standard operating procedures

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,760
to create their metadata and often

12
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,180
being the ones to have to fix this problem

13
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,320
when it is eventually noticed.

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,140
What you&#39;ll see here in this example

15
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,830
that I&#39;m going to go through with you

16
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:45,800
is that we have a category option

17
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,400
of five years and above

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,833
and a category option of five years plus.

19
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,230
So these individual category options

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:55,650
are duplicates of one another.

21
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,420
And this can create a lot of havoc later on,

22
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,680
as you&#39;ll see as we go through the model for this.

23
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,380
So what happens in this scenario?

24
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,663
So I have these two category options.

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,980
Now I&#39;m going to assign those to different categories,

26
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,640
to different category combinations.

27
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,220
This is going to result

28
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,690
in different category option combinations being generated

29
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:21,960
based upon those category options.

30
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,320
Now where this becomes challenging

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,180
is when they&#39;re completely different.

32
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:28,180
So they have different IDs.

33
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,260
So what you&#39;ll see here

34
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,940
is there&#39;s a group of category option combinations

35
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:36,330
in this green square that are the same,

36
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,880
but you can see the name is identical across all of them.

37
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,280
What has happened is a category option

38
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,600
is used in multiple category combinations essentially.

39
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,960
And this is generated, you still have to be

40
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,620
a bit careful here because you want to make sure

41
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,490
that you&#39;re storing your data in the right place.

42
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:57,110
So this has a big impact on data exchange for example,

43
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,160
when you wanna move data from maybe one system to another,

44
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,160
or you&#39;re importing data, whatever it is that you&#39;re doing,

45
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,170
because you wanna make sure that you&#39;re looking up

46
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,640
the appropriate category option combination

47
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:10,630
that&#39;s associated with the proper category combination

48
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,930
that&#39;s tied to your data element.

49
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,340
Now the reason you wanna get this right

50
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,400
is because when you bring in that data, you know,

51
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,350
if you bring it into the wrong category option combination,

52
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,370
then the data will not be correct at all.

53
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,210
And you will have to kind of go through a different process.

54
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,820
And of course, if you&#39;re always selecting

55
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,990
different category combinations

56
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,150
that are associated with category option combinations,

57
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,090
you&#39;ll have the same problem.

58
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,490
So let&#39;s stick with the orange bars, the orange boxes,

59
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,540
five years and above and five years plus.

60
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,090
Now what&#39;s in this green box, this is okay,

61
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,390
it&#39;s the exact same name, it&#39;s associated

62
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,390
with different category combinations essentially.

63
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:52,200
But these two ones in the orange boxes,

64
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,870
these are problematic, they&#39;re problematic,

65
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,440
both from any kind of data exchange standpoint,

66
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,100
where you&#39;re trying to bring in data

67
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,120
or even just store the data, you know,

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,530
because you might have then your data split

69
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,020
between these two, even though they should be

70
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,343
exactly the same.

71
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,760
And then they&#39;re also a problem

72
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,730
from the analysis point of view.

73
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,130
Which one do I select when I want to review my data?

74
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,940
Am I selecting the wrong one?

75
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,120
So on top of creating a host of data quality issues,

76
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,990
because now you&#39;re storing what is the similar object

77
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,550
in two different places basically,

78
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:28,590
the data is spread amongst these two

79
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,313
category option combinations.

80
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,870
Then you have this problem

81
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:37,870
where you&#39;re not even sure which one to select.

82
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,350
So what we can do, so I mentioned earlier

83
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,290
this concept of category option groups and group sets.

84
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,800
When I talked about desegregations collapsing,

85
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,590
that previous example was when zero

86
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:52,460
to one and one to four collapsed to less than five.

87
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,710
In this scenario, we can also take

88
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:57,200
our disparate category option combinations

89
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,150
and use category auction groups and group sets

90
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,350
in order to kind of at least for the user,

91
00:04:03,350 --> 00:04:04,973
hide this problem.

92
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:10,220
So what we can do is we can create two

93
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,820
category option groups, one that is less than five

94
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:18,160
and one that is greater than or equal to five.

95
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,150
In our system, we&#39;re lucky enough that the under five years

96
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:22,350
does not have duplicates.

97
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,370
So there&#39;s no less than five something with a symbol

98
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,890
or something written out with the words less than,

99
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,840
and then five or whatever it might be.

100
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,050
There&#39;s only one under five, but for five years and above,

101
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,820
we have these two copies of each other.

102
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,800
And from the user&#39;s perspective,

103
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,190
what we can do is we can hide this entirely.

104
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:43,640
So this is something we can kind of help and support.

105
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,220
Now, maybe it was in the past this was done.

106
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,010
Maybe this is something that was, you know,

107
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,890
when we&#39;re supporting that configuration happened over time.

108
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,640
Maybe there was a lack of coordination,

109
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,550
whatever the reasoning behind this,

110
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,860
and this is often, you know,

111
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,340
something that does happen in practice,

112
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:00,370
there is a way at least to hide it from the user.

113
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,560
We just have to be very careful, of course,

114
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,980
when we&#39;re bringing in data or storing data

115
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:06,900
or whatever we&#39;re doing with that data

116
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,030
to make sure it&#39;s associated

117
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,990
with the right category option combination.

118
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,530
But let&#39;s have a look at this again, right?

119
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,420
So we create these two category option groups,

120
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,310
and this might be kind of a new concept

121
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:21,090
and I&#39;ll go over the actual example of this.

122
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,460
So we create these two category option groups,

123
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,720
and then we create what we call a category option group set,

124
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,580
which is comprised

125
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,470
of the category option groups that we create.

126
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,310
So let&#39;s actually go into DHIS2

127
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:34,180
so we can get a better idea

128
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,830
of what it is that we&#39;re talking.

129
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,490
Okay, let&#39;s have a look

130
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:40,463
at the example that I&#39;m discussing.

131
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,320
I&#39;m in the category option group

132
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,120
maintenance part of the app.

133
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,960
So I&#39;m going to go to less than five.

134
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,893
This is the first category option group that I created.

135
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:01,380
If I scroll down, we can see that I&#39;ve added

136
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,840
one category option, under five years,

137
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,930
this is basically a duplicate

138
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:09,730
of the under five years category option

139
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:12,800
that already exists in our system,

140
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,480
but we&#39;re not able to create category option group sets

141
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,770
based on category options alone.

142
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,700
So we have to kind of replicate it

143
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,453
in order to get the process to be the same as before.

144
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:28,570
I&#39;ll just go back and I&#39;ll go to my greater than

145
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:29,653
or equal to five.

146
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:36,620
So we can see here, I&#39;ve added the two category options

147
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,340
that are copies of each other.

148
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,840
These are duplicate category options.

149
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,370
And what I want to do is I basically want to hide

150
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:46,600
the fact that there are duplicate category options

151
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,250
in this particular system, right?

152
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,380
So I don&#39;t want the user to have any idea

153
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,053
that this exists basically.

154
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:02,620
So what I do, I create these two category option groups,

155
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,743
and then I create the category option group set.

156
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,733
So we can see here,

157
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:13,143
less than five and greater than or equal to five.

158
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,220
Okay, so I&#39;ll just go down here and we can see here,

159
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,410
you select from your available category option groups,

160
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,420
not your category options.

161
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,970
So that&#39;s why we have to create

162
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,900
individual category, option groups,

163
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,390
even if they contain same information

164
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:32,120
that&#39;s present in our category options.

165
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,820
You know, it&#39;s not the easiest process.

166
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,710
It&#39;s not the easiest process to understand certainly.

167
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,830
And you require a lot of experience

168
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,970
with the category model to understand this, but you know,

169
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:45,110
it&#39;s something we can do to help users

170
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,560
from seeing these particular problems

171
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,680
that exist in our database.

172
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,823
Now, because I&#39;ve selected this as a data dimension here,

173
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,653
let me just open up data visualizer.

174
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:02,330
Now you can see that I have this dimension here,

175
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:05,070
less than five, greater than or equal to five.

176
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,560
And when I click on this, you&#39;ll see

177
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,530
there&#39;s only two options there.

178
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,520
Even though we know in this group,

179
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,320
greater than or equal to five,

180
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,000
we actually have two category options,

181
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,100
two category option groups

182
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:21,930
associated with this particular group set.

183
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,940
So what we&#39;re seeing here is the group set, right?

184
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,860
And it&#39;s comprised of these kind of groups, right?

185
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,420
So this is a group set here, and these are our groups.

186
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,640
So this hides from the user completely,

187
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,710
the fact that there are two separate under five, or sorry,

188
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:39,420
two separate, greater than or equal to fives in our system.

189
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:43,200
And we can use this to then desegregate our data

190
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,680
without worrying about which one should I be using

191
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,140
for which data element, right?

192
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:50,850
It&#39;s something maybe that should be fixed in the future,

193
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:53,430
but this allows for a temporary fix to take place

194
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,980
in order to kind of hide this,

195
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:57,133
mask this from the user essentially.
