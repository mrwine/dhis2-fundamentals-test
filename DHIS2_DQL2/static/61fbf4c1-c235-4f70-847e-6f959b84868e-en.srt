1
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:06,553
- [Instructor] I&#39;m going to present

2
00:00:06,553 --> 00:00:11,150
how you can quickly train staff at district

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,150
and even facility level to make use every month

4
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:20,223
of the WHO Data Quality Tool.

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,950
First, I want to share with you a single slide

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,820
that explains why data quality assurance

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,043
should be decentralized and it should be routine.

8
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,890
Let me define some of these terms.

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:42,890
By data quality assurance, I mean a continuous process

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,730
of checking the quality of the data

11
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:50,760
and investigating where there are suspicious values

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,760
and if necessary editing the data to remove any errors.

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:01,460
By decentralized, we mean that data quality assurance

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,660
is best done at the level of the district

15
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,040
and the health facility.

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,060
And this process should be routine,

17
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,050
that is should be done every month

18
00:01:13,050 --> 00:01:15,723
as data are entered into the system.

19
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,533
This is a bottom up approach to data quality assurance.

20
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,970
It is more efficient for data quality problems to be fixed

21
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:33,190
closer to where the data are first recorded and reported,

22
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,180
rather than wait for staff at higher levels,

23
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:41,850
regional or national to review and attempt

24
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,670
to fix these data quality problems.

25
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:48,050
This is for several reasons.

26
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:50,540
First of all, at the district level,

27
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,890
the volume of data to review is smaller,

28
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:58,180
especially if the data are reviewed every month

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,710
rather than waiting months later to identify

30
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,473
and investigate suspicious values.

31
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:10,090
Secondly, investigation of suspicious values

32
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,870
is more practical for staff at a decentralized level.

33
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:19,610
The district staff have access to the paper records.

34
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,770
They have established relationships with the facility staff,

35
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:26,960
and it can more easily communicate with them

36
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,360
to undertake investigations.

37
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,360
And finally, DHIS2 data belong to the district

38
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,290
and district staff have the permission to edit them

39
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,803
and remove any errors.

40
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,490
So let&#39;s get started with a demonstration of how district

41
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:54,000
and perhaps facility staff, can be trained quickly

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,560
to use the DHIS2 data quality review tools.

43
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:06,310
First of all, the user needs to understand

44
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:11,063
how to launch the WHO Data Quality Tool.

45
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,830
Users at district level do not need to understand how to use

46
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,220
all the functions of the WHO Data Quality Tool.

47
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,260
In fact, they don&#39;t necessarily need to be instructed

48
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:32,260
in how to use all of the four tabs of the Dashboard.

49
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,700
They can simply understand the power of the outliers page

50
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,363
of the Dashboard.

51
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,360
They will first need a bit of orientation

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,310
to the settings window of the Dashboard.

53
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,440
They should understand

54
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,540
that they can make the settings window appear

55
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:59,033
and disappear by clicking on the settings icon.

56
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,330
For review of the quality of data at district level,

57
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:11,490
it&#39;s best to configure a special group of indicators

58
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:15,680
that are most important for review at district level.

59
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,150
So the data quality reviewer should set data

60
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:25,150
to district group and they should set period to last month

61
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:29,510
if the review is being done at the end of the month

62
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,690
when you have data entered for last month.

63
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:36,610
If review is done at the beginning of the month,

64
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,630
and it&#39;s probably best to set the period

65
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,023
to the month before last.

66
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,390
Now, how should the organization unit

67
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:52,820
of the settings window be configured?

68
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:57,250
If the user is at the level of the district,

69
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,240
then the organization unit is going to automatically be set

70
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,440
to show the data just for their district.

71
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:13,450
However, if you are practicing the instructions

72
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:17,140
of district staff at national level,

73
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:20,210
you&#39;ll have to configure the boundary

74
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:24,330
of the organization unit to the specific district

75
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,510
that you are supporting for data quality review.

76
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:30,803
In this case, we&#39;ve selected district A-1.

77
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:34,530
Again at district level,

78
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,800
they won&#39;t have to go through this process

79
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,720
because DHIS2 will automatically set the window

80
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,703
to show data only for their district.

81
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:50,580
The dis-aggregation should ideally be set to facility level.

82
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,360
In the case of this DHIS2 instance,

83
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,580
facility is the only level below district.

84
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:04,580
So the desegregation is automatically set to facility

85
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,320
as soon as we set the district,

86
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,040
as soon as we set the boundary to a single district.

87
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,740
But you may have two levels below the level of the district,

88
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,690
in which case the menu will show those two levels

89
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:22,940
and you should select facility.

90
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,470
By dis-aggregating to facility,

91
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:28,500
we&#39;ll see how it simplifies the process

92
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,890
for the person doing the data quality review

93
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,763
at district level.

94
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,220
To free up space on the screen,

95
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,263
it&#39;s best to hide the settings window.

96
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:48,390
Users at district level will need a bit of explanation

97
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:53,163
to understand the table, the results table that appears.

98
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,070
They&#39;ll need to understand that all of the data

99
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:02,070
are for their district and that each row represents data

100
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,150
for one health facility in their district

101
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:08,683
and one of the indicators in the district group.

102
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:13,260
The data and the row are for the 12 months

103
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,343
leading up to the period that has been selected.

104
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,210
Users need to understand that values that are highlighted

105
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,210
in red are suspicious and cells that are pale yellow,

106
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:29,103
have missing values.

107
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:34,810
The results table is lengthy,

108
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:38,300
so users need to understand how to filter it

109
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:43,300
in order to identify only the most suspicious values.

110
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:48,670
And the filtering process involves as we have learned

111
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,223
to click on options,

112
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:57,160
and then they can include the Z-score in the table.

113
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,360
Users need to understand that the Z-score

114
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,050
is simply a measure of how suspicious the value in red

115
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,030
is with a higher Z-score.

116
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:11,550
In this case, the modified Z-score

117
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,940
showing that the value is more suspicious.

118
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,733
We can now filter the table to show only values

119
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,570
that have a modified Z-score that is quite high

120
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:30,570
by clicking on outliers and modified Z-score and extreme.

121
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:37,260
We now have a relatively small table of the most important,

122
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:42,210
suspicious values for the reviewer

123
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,053
at district level to investigate.

124
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:51,200
They should follow up on at least the first page

125
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,770
of the filtered results table.

126
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:59,430
For some of these values, let&#39;s take for example,

127
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:04,430
the value that is highlighted in red in the first row.

128
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:12,920
And the user can be taught how to use the menu icon

129
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,810
and click on visualize in order to see this chart.

130
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,280
For this value, they may have an explanation.

131
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,200
They may understand that this facility

132
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,070
indeed had an increase in out-patient attendance.

133
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,070
So not all values that are highlighted in red

134
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:37,510
will require extensive investigation.

135
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:41,430
But the point is, that the data quality reviewer,

136
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:44,970
needs to understand why it is that that value

137
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:48,633
is so different from the other values in the row.

138
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:56,610
Again, they can be taught how to click on the menu icon

139
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:59,053
at the end of a row and visual utilize.

140
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:05,260
And they will almost certainly see that some of the values

141
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:08,530
that are highlighted in red are so suspicious

142
00:10:08,530 --> 00:10:11,596
that they are likely erroneous, that they are errors,

143
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:16,596
and deserve to be followed up with a phone call

144
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,160
or some other communication to people

145
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,593
at facility level.

146
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:29,023
In addition to investigating the suspicious values,

147
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:31,780
the reviewer at district level

148
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,780
needs to look into the most important missing values

149
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,050
and to use the outlier tab to identify those missing values,

150
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,273
they should be taught to turn off the filter,

151
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,120
click on missing data,

152
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,810
and now the results table shows at the top.

153
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:56,400
Those indicators and those health facilities,

154
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:00,550
which have the largest volume of missing data.

155
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:05,040
And it may be worthwhile for them to make attempts

156
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,040
to mobilize these additional data context in this case,

157
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,730
the district hospital,

158
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:16,330
and see if they can get these missing reports.

159
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:21,330
After all, the values from the district hospital are so high

160
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:24,230
that if the reports are missing,

161
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:27,760
it will affect the total performance measurement

162
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,913
as measured at the district level.

163
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:35,620
Finally, the user at district level should understand

164
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,920
how to use the download button,

165
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,610
so that they can download to their computer

166
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,610
and visualize a spreadsheet that they can use

167
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:53,502
even when they are not connected to the internet.

168
00:11:53,502 --> 00:11:56,002
(phone rings)

169
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,220
And they could print this out

170
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,373
and make use of it in supervision.

171
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,490
The user at district level may already understand how to use

172
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:12,370
the sorting functions of Excel,

173
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,800
but you might need to refresh them

174
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,800
that if they click on data and then sort this table,

175
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:25,810
can be sorted according to the values of one row.

176
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:30,460
In this case, let&#39;s select the maximum modified Z-score

177
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:32,680
and largest to smallest,

178
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,380
and now we see at the top the values

179
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,263
that are most suspicious.

180
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,780
Or they might filter this

181
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,520
to find the most important missing values

182
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,520
sorting in this case, by the modified,

183
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,500
by the gap weight, largest to smallest.

184
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,500
And here again, we see the facilities that are responsible

185
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,983
for the most important missing data.

186
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:28,160
In summary, to instruct staff at district or facility level

187
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,570
to use the tool in a short amount of time,

188
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:36,890
perhaps even during the supervision visit,

189
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,450
the instruction should focus on how they can quickly learn

190
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:46,450
how to make use of the outlier page of the Dashboard,

191
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:51,770
and how they can by screening the data

192
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:56,040
routinely every month, identify and investigate

193
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:59,660
the most important missing and suspicious values.

194
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,030
And in this way,

195
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:06,030
maintain the quality of the data bottom up approach.

196
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:08,875
(upbeat music)
