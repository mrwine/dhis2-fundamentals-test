<h3>What’s In This Module?</h3> 
<p class- "text">Small design decisions can drastically impact how we interact with different systems. So, how does the design of DHIS2 impact how you capture data? How does it impact the quality of your data? </p>
<p class- "text">In this module, Shurajit Dutta will look at <b>how DHIS2 System Design impacts Data Quality</b>. He’ll walk you through how to design and customize DHIS2 to facilitate Data Quality. Through a series of  videos, Shurajit will teach you <b>how to set up your DHIS2 system to avoid bad data capture</b>, which can significantly impact data quality. You’ll learn some <b>best practices for managing different data dimensions</b>, and be able to identify <b>how manual review processes can contribute to DHIS2 system design review</b>.</p>
<h3>Learning objectives</h3>
<p class- "text">By the end of this module you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Review data capture forms design to avoid duplicate variables</li>
  <li>Identify procedural challenges associated with managing metadata</li>
  <li>Distinguish data element value types</li>
  <li>Identify best practices for managing data dimensions and duplicate data elements, and data set design</li>
  <li>Describe  General Maintenance Challenges and Organisation Unit Management's Effect on Data Quality</li>
  <li>Describe the link between user management and data access, and challenges with sharing</li>
  <li>Identify how manual review processes can contribute to DHIS2 system design review</li>
  <li>Identify the key principles used for naming indicators and data elements and apply them.</li>
  <li>Identify how SQL scripts  can be used to support assessments of DHIS2 system design</li>
</ul>
<h3>How will you be evaluated?</h3>
