(upbeat music)

1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,461
- [Instructor] With this video, I&#39;m going to present

2
00:00:08,461 --> 00:00:10,550
to you how to use

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,160
the Consistency-time page

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,633
of the dashboard of the WHO Data Quality Tool.

5
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,313
Let&#39;s click on the tab for Consistency-time.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,550
And then, so that our screen will match up

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:32,480
with the screenshots in the guide,

8
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,790
we&#39;ll set Data to Core,

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,023
Period to April,

10
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:42,653
and Disaggregation to District.

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:48,060
Now, if we want to free up some space on our screen,

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,670
we can make the settings window disappear

13
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,133
by clicking on the settings icon.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,820
Let&#39;s look at the charts on this page.

15
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:06,310
We see that there are charts for several indicators,

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,463
ANC 1st visits,

17
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,520
if we scroll down, ANC 4th visits,

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,623
HIV tests done,

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:20,710
Institutional deliveries,

20
00:01:20,710 --> 00:01:25,223
Penta 3 given before the age of 12 months,

21
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:30,450
and Under 5 OPD malaria as a percentage

22
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,963
of total outpatient malaria.

23
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,853
For each of these indicators,

24
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:40,353
the page has two charts.

25
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:46,560
The chart on the left has three different lines

26
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,153
in different colors.

27
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:51,223
Let&#39;s explore these lines.

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:57,040
The dark blue line is showing the trend

29
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,870
in the number of ANC 1st visits

30
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,870
from May of 2019

31
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:09,900
through April of 2020,

32
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,373
which is the period that we selected.

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,860
And then, what is this light blue line?

34
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,060
Well, the light blue line is also showing the trend

35
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,003
over a 12 month period.

36
00:02:23,003 --> 00:02:26,780
But in this case, it is the months

37
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,683
from May of 2018,

38
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,273
to April of 2019.

39
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,770
And then, the orange line shows the trend

40
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,320
over another 12 month period, which is May of 2017

41
00:02:44,148 --> 00:02:46,810
to April of 2018.

42
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,670
So, each of the lines is showing the trend

43
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,950
over a 12 month period,

44
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:56,273
whether it&#39;s between 1 and 11 months previously,

45
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,940
or 12 and 23 months previously,

46
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:06,580
or 24 and 35 months previously.

47
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,410
This is an example of what is called

48
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,310
a year on year chart,

49
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,870
because we have placed the findings for one year

50
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,523
on top of the findings for other years.

51
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:23,640
And we noticed from these charts,

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,640
that the values of ANC 1st visits go up and down a bit,

53
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,100
but most months they don&#39;t jump up or down a great deal.

54
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:36,283
But we see two exceptions.

55
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,660
There&#39;s this outlier, this value that&#39;s very different

56
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,063
from other months, in January of 2020.

57
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:52,093
Back here, in May of 2019, we also see a jump up.

58
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:58,030
So, the year on year chart is good to show

59
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:02,000
how the value for a single month can be quite different,

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,090
not only different from the months in that year,

61
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,533
but different from the value for months in other years.

62
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:17,250
Let&#39;s look now, at the chart on the right side of the page.

63
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:22,170
This is a special kind of chart, also.

64
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,113
It&#39;s called a scatter plot.

65
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,670
This is because the values are scattered.

66
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,220
Each of these dots represents the values

67
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,790
for a single district.

68
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,320
If we place the cursor on the dot, then a window appears

69
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,053
showing that this is for District C-5.

70
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:48,010
And what does the value along the vertical axis represent?

71
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,330
Well, as we see, the value on the vertical axis

72
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,330
is the number of first ANC visits in April of 2020,

73
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,403
which was 3,917.

74
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:07,763
What does the value on the horizontal axis represent?

75
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,720
Horizontal axis is the average value of ANC visits

76
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,720
for that district during the 11 months prior to April 2020.

77
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:25,380
So, this would be from May of 2019 until March of 2020.

78
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:32,540
And the two values, they aren&#39;t the same,

79
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,230
but they are close to each other,

80
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:38,970
and that&#39;s why this dot is close to the line.

81
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:43,560
This line represents districts,

82
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,810
which have exactly, or almost exactly,

83
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:50,369
the same value in April 2020 as they had

84
00:05:50,369 --> 00:05:53,810
during the average of the previous 11 months.

85
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:58,113
And all of the dots, where the two values,

86
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,010
the value for April 20,

87
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,900
and the value for the previous 11 months,

88
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,570
where those two values are almost the same,

89
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,680
they&#39;re close to this black line,

90
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,593
and they fall between the two gray lines.

91
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,543
Now there&#39;s one dot where there&#39;s an exception.

92
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,420
It was this dot down here.

93
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:24,240
And notice that the dot has a diamond shape,

94
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,240
rather than a circular shape of the dots that appear

95
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,030
between the two gray lines.

96
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:38,030
So, dots which are suspicious have a different shape.

97
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:43,420
This is for District B-2, which in April of 2020

98
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:48,610
reported a total of 1,425 first ANC visits.

99
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,880
Whereas, the average reported by this district

100
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,680
during the previous 11 months was 4,595.

101
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,830
So these are quite different.

102
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,720
The value on the vertical axis is quite different

103
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,700
from the value on the horizontal axis.

104
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:10,510
So this dot is placed outside

105
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:13,173
and identified as an outlier.

106
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,070
Let me show you how we might investigate

107
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,923
this outlier by changing the period.

108
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:29,833
The outlier appears in January of 2020.

109
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,460
So what if we change the period of these charts

110
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:38,193
to January of 2020?

111
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:42,900
Again, let&#39;s free up space by making the settings window

112
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,270
disappear.

113
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,100
And notice how the charts have changed.

114
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,100
Now, we still see trend lines in the chart on the left,

115
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,350
but in this case, the trend for the blue line is from

116
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:02,350
February of 2019 to January of 2020,

117
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,490
the period that we select.

118
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,763
And we see our outlier here.

119
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,063
Look at the chart on the right now.

120
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,290
Well, apart from these districts,

121
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:22,700
which had values in January of 2020,

122
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,880
which were reasonably close to the average

123
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:30,770
for the previous 11 months, there&#39;s a single dot up here.

124
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,680
And it is for District B-2.

125
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:39,680
So, in January of 2020, District B-2

126
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,720
reported a very large, and probably incorrect,

127
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,720
value of 36,835 first ANC visits.

128
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,980
When you compare this to the average

129
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,360
of the previous 11 months,

130
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,360
it reported only 1,363 first ANC visits

131
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:04,630
during those previous 11 months.

132
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:08,270
So this dot is showing far from the reference line,

133
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:12,303
far from the line showing equal values.

134
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:19,350
And can you explain now why it is that we saw-

135
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,900
let&#39;s go back to April, keep in mind the value

136
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,900
reported for District B-2 in January of 2020, almost 37,000-

137
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,123
if we change the period back to April,

138
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,023
can you explain why the dot was below the line in April?

139
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:51,890
Well, in fact, this dot is below the line in April

140
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,023
because the average of the previous 11 months,

141
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,090
when we are looking at the chart, based on April,

142
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,320
the average includes this very high and incorrect value

143
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,900
that was reported in January.

144
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,350
And so, that increases so much the average

145
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:18,350
over the previous 11 months that it pulls this dot away

146
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,810
from the reference line.

147
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:24,570
So that&#39;s an example of how you can do some investigation

148
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,280
by changing the period.

149
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,520
And you could also do some investigation

150
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,290
by changing the organization unit and drill down.

151
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,930
However, we will see how it is much easier

152
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,600
to drill down and do investigations when we talk about

153
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,000
the outlier page.

154
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,680
Before we leave the Consistency-time page,

155
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,680
I want to show you how we can change data,

156
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,210
and what happens to the Consistency-time page

157
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,963
when we change data.

158
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:04,110
At present, data includes, as you see,

159
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,090
one or two indicators from multiple programs,

160
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:10,553
antenatal care program,

161
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,930
HIV program,

162
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,770
this is labor and delivery program,

163
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:21,160
immunization, and a malaria indicator.

164
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:24,690
Notice that there&#39;s only a single immunization indicator

165
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:29,223
now included when we have data set to core.

166
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:35,070
But what happens if we change core to immunization?

167
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,683
Wait a while for the data to be processed.

168
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,750
And now, let&#39;s scroll down the page

169
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,590
and see which indicators are included

170
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,810
on the Consistency-time page.

171
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:56,280
Well, we see a new indicator, a new immunization indicator,

172
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,410
BCG, Measles,

173
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,920
OPV 1,

174
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,690
OPV 2, 3,

175
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,760
Penta 1, 2, 3,

176
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,240
Rotavirus 1 and 2.

177
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,140
So, by changing to a different group,

178
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,820
changing data to one of these other groups,

179
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:20,373
we can look at a larger group of programs,

180
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,110
specific indicators,

181
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,740
and we can do a data quality review

182
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:30,763
that is specific to that program.

183
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,460
Here, if we change to the HIV program,

184
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:39,460
we see a larger number of HIV indicators on the dashboard.

185
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,720
So, that&#39;s an example of how changing data

186
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,720
allows us to provide a more detailed look

187
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,590
at a more extensive set of indicators.

188
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:00,680
And later, we will practice changing this

189
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:05,280
to the district group, which has been especially designed

190
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,969
for data quality review of indicators

191
00:13:07,969 --> 00:13:11,223
of greatest relevance at the district level.

192
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,397
Thank you.

193
00:13:13,397 --> 00:13:15,980
(upbeat music)
