00:00:00,130 --> 00:00:01,750
- [Instructor] So this is the play instance,

1
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:04,300
which I think you&#39;re all familiar with.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,300
And if we launch the data quality app,

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,993
are you all seeing that on your screen, by the way?

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:16,100
If we launch the data quality app

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:21,010
you immediately get this message that says that it&#39;s not,

6
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,010
hasn&#39;t been configured and this,

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:29,790
you&#39;ll see this as soon as it&#39;s installed,

8
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:33,190
but I&#39;m skipping ahead here because I wanted

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:38,190
to first comment a bit on the installation of the app.

10
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:43,713
It&#39;s like any app, if you go to app management,

11
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,920
you can find it in what used to be called the App Store.

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,610
Now it&#39;s in the App Hub under standard apps.

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,910
You see that the instance already has it installed,

14
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,830
but sometimes you want to re-install the latest version.

15
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,720
I find a number of national instances

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,610
where they have an outdated version

17
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:09,450
of the data quality tool.

18
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,000
The current one in the hub is version 1.2.3.

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,793
Let me move this out of the way.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,010
And in some cases, it&#39;s best

21
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:27,010
to install this over the outdated version

22
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:30,480
that is on a national instance.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,680
Fortunately, when you do that,

24
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,640
it&#39;s very user-friendly because it will preserve

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,060
whatever configuration has been done

26
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,050
with the previous national instance.

27
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:42,960
You don&#39;t have to worry about starting from scratch

28
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,313
when you re-install the latest version.

29
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:52,043
I think of it as rebooting the computer.

30
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,520
When the old version, there are issues with it.

31
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,370
Maybe there was some bugs, some incompatibility.

32
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:03,300
So it&#39;s often worth asking that question,

33
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,053
is the most recent version installed?

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:11,060
We also want to reassure you that installation

35
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,930
of this app on the production instance,

36
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,510
we, so far, have had absolutely no issues

37
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:23,763
with that disturbing the rest of the configuration.

38
00:02:24,771 --> 00:02:27,350
So we used to tell people in data quality academies

39
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,870
that you should first do this on a training instance,

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,230
on a development instance.

41
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:34,980
And that&#39;s certainly good hygiene

42
00:02:36,833 --> 00:02:38,540
to use a development instance first,

43
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:41,720
before you install new things.

44
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,720
But in this case, we feel rather confident that

45
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,030
this will not create problems, if it is installed

46
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,410
on the development instance.

47
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:57,720
Before, so installation, you click on there

48
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,340
and it will install,

49
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,890
then it will appear under the standard apps.

50
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,400
Now, the next thing I wanted to comment on

51
00:03:06,791 --> 00:03:10,370
is access to the data quality tool.

52
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,020
In another number of cases,

53
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,580
even after the data quality academy,

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,460
some months after data quality academy,

55
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:21,060
I&#39;ve gone on to the production instance

56
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,260
and found that the tool is installed,

57
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,533
but it simply hasn&#39;t been shared.

58
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:32,290
So, I want to remind you that to work

59
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:36,823
with the national administrator and the authorities,

60
00:03:38,346 --> 00:03:43,346
to come up with a good policy on who has access to the tool,

61
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:48,320
if the tool is there and it&#39;s hidden from folks,

62
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:51,320
then it&#39;s really not that useful.

63
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:53,863
And of course, this is a governance issue,

64
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:58,320
but I prefer that everybody have access

65
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,840
to the data quality tools.

66
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,260
So in this case,

67
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,353
I&#39;m even going into the user role of guests,

68
00:04:05,688 --> 00:04:09,770
and I&#39;m going to assign this to the guests, even,

69
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,593
so that even they have access and saving it.

70
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,680
This isn&#39;t a necessary step when you use the play instance,

71
00:04:21,204 --> 00:04:24,820
because you are automatically given the super user role

72
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,630
when you log on to the play instance.

73
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,950
But again, this is one bottleneck

74
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:33,560
that you&#39;ll find on national instances,

75
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,560
and they need to feel comfortable with transparently showing

76
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:43,783
to people the issues of data quality.

77
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,973
This is obviously a governance issue.

78
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:48,693
Okay.

79
00:04:49,765 --> 00:04:51,090
And one which

80
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:55,960
we might discuss further,

81
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,310
the issue of who has access,

82
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,387
but in the interest of time, let&#39;s.
