00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:02,160
- [Jenny] I&#39;m going to kick off the session

1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:06,380
by giving you a bit of a historical perspective

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,097
on where South Africa was during the 1990s

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:15,713
and then in the early 2000s.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,920
What we had is I think a very familiar scenario

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,683
to most of you that are attending this training.

6
00:00:26,499 --> 00:00:30,580
Your countries probably experienced the same thing.

7
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:35,693
We had multiple health authorities.

8
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,610
These authorities use multiple forms for collecting data

9
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,290
and the data collection tools were not at all standardized.

10
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:47,280
In fact, when we did research on this,

11
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,870
we did find that there were

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,783
up to 50 plus data collection tools in a single facility.

13
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,640
It was largely a paper-based system.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,040
And obviously this made analysis very difficult,

15
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,480
and we found the data wasn&#39;t being used.

16
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:09,480
And really if you submitted data or didn&#39;t submit data,

17
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,870
it wasn&#39;t picked up very quickly.

18
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,610
I&#39;ll give you an example of this.

19
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,100
There was a health authority in the Eastern Cape

20
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:23,380
at that time that decided they would really like to have

21
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,320
a lot more coherent information system,

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,140
developed a very primitive,

23
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,550
some simple minimum data set

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,060
with standardized data collection tools,

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,140
and had a method for analyzing this.

26
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,590
It was still paper based,

27
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:44,590
but it gave the facility managers the opportunity to see

28
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,100
what performance was, to graph that performance,

29
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,050
and then take action accordingly.

30
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,930
And in the process,

31
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:58,110
this health authority decided that they wouldn&#39;t submit data

32
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:03,490
to the province at that stage.

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,900
And so it took about a year and a half

34
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:11,823
before this was even picked up and queried.

35
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,690
It was also the beginning, shall I say,

36
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:22,690
this simplistic, primitive data information system

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,890
that was started there.

38
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:29,410
There was a parallel process happening

39
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,860
through the University of the Western Cape in Khayelitsha

40
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:37,860
where they were testing DHIS1 at that stage,

41
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,910
which is a non-web based system,

42
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:45,260
or was a non-web-based system.

43
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,260
And there was cooperation between the two parties,

44
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,697
which really led to the introduction of DHIS1 one,

45
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,440
first of all in the region

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,340
that this health authority was situated in,

47
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,870
and then escalated to the province

48
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:08,820
when they saw that really we&#39;re getting

49
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:12,420
much more useful data to work with

50
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,820
based on this development.

51
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,820
And so DHIS1 essentially used the minimum data sets

52
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,180
and what was being collected in that authority to populate

53
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,370
DHIS1 with some additions.

54
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:35,710
And it was rolled out, as I said,

55
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,080
to the Eastern Cape province.

56
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,390
And then because Eastern Cape

57
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,333
implemented it so successfully,

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,650
the national government became interested

59
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,183
and DHIS was eventually rolled out to the entire country.

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,280
As I said before, it was a computerized database,

61
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,330
not web-based.

62
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:01,240
It was based on MS Access and pivot tables.

63
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:06,240
But it did have some very good data quality features

64
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,140
amongst which we had data regression and interpolation.

65
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:16,140
We included validation rules, both absolute and statistical.

66
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:19,100
And for us, very importantly,

67
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:24,100
it had a very user-friendly method of customizing data sets

68
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,780
per facility type,

69
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,880
which allowed us to monitor completeness

70
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,430
of the data element capturing for those data sets.

71
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:41,871
This data was then extracted into standardized pivot tables,

72
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:44,513
using a DataMart functionality,

73
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,270
and then the data analysis and reporting

74
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,420
was done from there.

75
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,750
And people, in general, were very comfortable

76
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,030
with that system.

77
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:56,300
Together, with what was in the database,

78
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,280
we had a number of other initiatives

79
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,610
to facilitate the implementation.

80
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,830
The country developed a minimum data set

81
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,560
with standardized data collection tools.

82
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,850
We had a district health management

83
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,407
information system policy with a set of SOPs

84
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,700
ranging from the facility level

85
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,433
right up to provincial national level, which...

86
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,420
What would be the right word?

87
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,420
Which set out what was required from the users of data.

88
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,770
And also, very importantly,

89
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,460
the country began to employ information staff

90
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,710
in both the districts and provinces

91
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:51,710
to operationalize this whole DHIS1 roll out.

92
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,970
What we used to do in those days

93
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,410
was when a new form was introduced,

94
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:05,060
data quality checks were done within three to four months

95
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,500
to make sure that everyone

96
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,800
was interpreting the definitions correctly,

97
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,350
and so what was being captured in the system,

98
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,430
that was consistent and coherent,

99
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,700
and everyone was collecting the same,

100
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,743
and we could compare apples with apples.

101
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:25,000
We also undertook an extensive training on data quality

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,620
and on use of information

103
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:30,320
to ensure that people understood

104
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,510
the importance of the data quality

105
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,510
and that really the point of collecting data

106
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:41,800
is to make sure that it is used,

107
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,020
and it&#39;s not just collecting data for data sake.

108
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,720
Another initiative at that stage was that we introduced

109
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:54,010
pre-submission data validation,

110
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:56,260
and we developed a standardized template

111
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:00,673
for people to collect this, to do the pre-submission on.

112
00:07:03,238 --> 00:07:04,660
I&#39;m going to talk more to this point

113
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,780
on pre-submission later.

114
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,050
So I won&#39;t give too much detail here. Sorry.

115
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,420
And the final thing was

116
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,190
that South Africa has a process

117
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:19,030
where data is locked at the end of the financial year

118
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:22,600
so that no further editing can be done.

119
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,090
So in addition to doing pre-submission data validation,

120
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,440
the country had data cleanup workshops in each province

121
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,340
to make sure that we picked up on anything

122
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,930
that would seriously skew the data before locking.

123
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,830
And the data&#39;s locked

124
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,003
and people prepared their annual reports based on that.

125
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,310
So why did we stick with DHIS1 for so long,

126
00:07:51,157 --> 00:07:55,083
and why did we then decide to update to DHIS2?

127
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,940
Mainly the delay was because of the data quality

128
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,210
and analytics features that DHIS1.4

129
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,890
that we were using at that stage had,

130
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:09,640
and the DHIS2 at that stage

131
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,530
that did not have all of the data quality features

132
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,520
that were available in DHIS1.4.

133
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,267
However, the compelling shortcomings in DHIS1.4

134
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,060
meant that we decided

135
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,803
that we really did need to move to DHIS2,

136
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:36,020
not least of which was the updating of standalone computers

137
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:40,280
at every capturing point when a new board was released,

138
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:42,480
and also the length of time

139
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,530
for data to reach the National Department of Health.

140
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,370
What we had at that stage was that

141
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,810
data that for a specific reporting period

142
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,770
would only be available in the national database

143
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:59,060
60 plus days after the reporting period,

144
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:04,060
which really didn&#39;t leave room for using the data.

145
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,090
It was more just getting a historical perspective

146
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,533
on what it looked like.

147
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:15,463
So now that we are on DHIS2,

148
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,410
we have certain data quality strategies

149
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,633
that we follow in the country.

150
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,920
Obviously we&#39;ve gone for a minimum data sets

151
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,610
because this impacts so heavily on data quality.

152
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,660
The more data you collect,

153
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,883
the more likely you are to have data quality issues.

154
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:40,970
The minimum data set, the process is that

155
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,560
it is revised every two years.

156
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,600
And it goes through a great amount of consultation

157
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,470
across all levels from national to province

158
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,890
to districts to sub-districts,

159
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,320
and the programs are given an opportunity to input into it.

160
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,550
And they also rigorously debate

161
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,870
what was in the previous data, minimum data set,

162
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:13,883
and anything that really wasn&#39;t used is kept out.

163
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:17,730
And once they&#39;ve settled on the minimum data set

164
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,360
for the next two-year period,

165
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,830
it is signed off by the Minister of Health.

166
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:27,010
Another strategy we have is daily data capturing.

167
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:29,330
We refer to it as DDC,

168
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:32,950
and it takes place at service point level.

169
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,260
The reason why we introduce daily data capturing

170
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:39,500
is because what we found

171
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:44,500
when the auditors audited the information system

172
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,500
in South Africa,

173
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,807
which is part of the legal requirements in the country,

174
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:55,180
they don&#39;t only look at finances,

175
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:58,470
they look at your information as well,

176
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,470
and what they found was that the majority of the areas

177
00:11:03,584 --> 00:11:07,500
that they found between the source documents and DHIS

178
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:10,170
were related to the correlation of data

179
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,263
much more so than with the capturing of that data.

180
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:20,400
So daily data capturing involves setting up,

181
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,530
I&#39;ll give you an example, a clinic.

182
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:26,250
Each of the consulting rooms in the clinic

183
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:30,910
where data is collected is then set up at level six

184
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:34,780
in the org unit hierarchy in DHIS.

185
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:39,780
And the data capture will then capture on a daily basis,

186
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,850
for that service point,

187
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,120
the data in their data collection tool.

188
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,593
It is not put into a summary form in a way.

189
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,070
It is captured directly from the data collection tools

190
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,190
into the database.

191
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:59,963
And in this way, we cut out the codation errors.

192
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,750
We also use standardized public dashboards

193
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,570
of which three are devoted to data quality.

194
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,210
And I&#39;ll talk to this a little bit later on.

195
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,870
Another strategy is to apply legends to our indicators.

196
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:18,490
We use robotized colors to show performance,

197
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:22,973
and then we also color code blue for any unlikely values

198
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,223
so that they stick out from a data quality point of view.

199
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:34,270
For data quality, we&#39;ve also developed two HTML reports.

200
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,150
One monitors the timeliness and completeness

201
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,280
prior to deadlines.

202
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,650
I will give you an example.

203
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:43,020
I will show you an example of this report a little later.

204
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:46,390
And also we have the element reporting rate

205
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:49,180
for our community outreach services.

206
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,770
It is the only service

207
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:53,520
where we were able to really look in detail

208
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,230
at element reporting rate

209
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,070
rather than finding other means

210
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:01,313
of trying to monitor completeness.

211
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,680
Then we have the pre-submission reports,

212
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,940
as I mentioned earlier,

213
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,970
that are in that standardized template.

214
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:16,290
And these pre-submission reports also meet the requirement

215
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,280
from the DHMIS,

216
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,300
District Health Management Information Systems, policy,

217
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:25,690
which requires the higher level to give feedback

218
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:27,460
to the lower level

219
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,223
within five days of them receiving the data.

220
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,120
We do a monthly data quality report

221
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,190
that is sent to the National Department of Health.

222
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:44,710
And this gives an overview of the data quality

223
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:49,470
within the DHIS for the reporting period.

224
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,300
And another strategy is that we do

225
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,730
rapid internal performance data audit,

226
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,830
where we compare source data with the values in the DHIS.

227
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:02,250
This mimics what the Auditor General of South Africa

228
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,583
would be doing when they visit facilities to audit.

229
00:14:07,762 --> 00:14:09,013
So what do we measure?

230
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:12,270
We measure timeliness and completeness

231
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:16,577
by using the flagging,

232
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,900
clicking on the Complete button after data entry

233
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,870
of a particular data set.

234
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:30,120
So basically what we do is we have the number of data sets

235
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,050
that are assigned to the facility

236
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:37,010
and then when that data set has been completed

237
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:39,540
in the data entry screen by the 10th of the month,

238
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,033
it is considered to be timely.

239
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:46,600
That&#39;s the 10th of the month following the reporting month.

240
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:50,460
And completeness is the same measurement, but in this case,

241
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,360
it is by the 30th of the month.

242
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,310
Obviously these are the proxies

243
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,900
for timeliness and completeness

244
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,330
because it is dependent on

245
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,340
people clicking on the Complete button.

246
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,500
And I could do that

247
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,130
without necessarily completing all the data

248
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,130
within the data set, or alternatively, they could forget

249
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,440
to click on the Complete button.

250
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,830
So it looks as though they haven&#39;t captured the data

251
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,260
when they have.

252
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,180
So in addition to these two,

253
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,430
we have program completeness,

254
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:25,950
and for program completeness,

255
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:30,950
what we do is we have selected proxy data elements

256
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:36,540
from each of the programs that are in the data sets,

257
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,703
and these are flagged.

258
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,210
And we also look at the number of facilities

259
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:48,820
that are expected to report on those proxy data elements.

260
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:52,470
And from this, we calculate the program completeness.

261
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,470
Also not an ideal method of measuring completeness,

262
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:59,340
but at least it gives an indication

263
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,970
that at least one of the data elements

264
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,820
has been captured for each program.

265
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,350
And the assumption is if they&#39;ve captured that one,

266
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,650
the likelihood is that they have been providing that service

267
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,763
and are reporting on it.

268
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:21,740
The ideal, of course, is to have an element reporting rate

269
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,950
with customized data sets.

270
00:16:23,950 --> 00:16:26,200
At this stage, we only do that

271
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,020
for the community outreach services

272
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:31,040
because it is a defined data set

273
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,410
which every single outreach service is expected to report on

274
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:37,760
every single data element.

275
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,820
As opposed to the program reporting rate

276
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,820
where you don&#39;t have the customized data sets

277
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:48,440
and you may have a facility that does not necessarily need

278
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,617
to report on all the data elements that are in the data sets

279
00:16:52,571 --> 00:16:55,120
that have been assigned to them.

280
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:59,530
We do missing and outlier analysis using the WH app.

281
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,860
And we do run validation rule reports

282
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,203
to pick up the violations as well.

283
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,770
So I said earlier

284
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:12,810
I would talk to the data quality dashboards,

285
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:14,410
the three that we have.

286
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:17,670
The one is called the Data Quality dashboard,

287
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,470
and it is like an overview

288
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:23,100
of the various data quality measures

289
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:26,550
that we have in the system.

290
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:29,480
And then we have two other dashboards

291
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,930
that are specific for use

292
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:35,057
at the lowest level of the hierarchy,

293
00:17:35,057 --> 00:17:39,080
and that is the Daily Data Capturing monitoring one

294
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,220
and the Data Quality monitoring.

295
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,230
The Daily Data Capturing monitoring one

296
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,260
is so that the managers can assess

297
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:53,260
whether the data at the daily data capturing site

298
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:56,480
is being captured on a daily basis

299
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,480
and not left for a week, two weeks, a month,

300
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,010
and then back captured,

301
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:09,010
because that would defeat the whole purpose

302
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,900
of trying to improve data quality using daily capturing.

303
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,700
And the Data Quality monitoring one

304
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,930
is really just used to be able to check on

305
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:25,750
those types of data elements

306
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:28,970
that are not suitable to check on

307
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,610
from a data quality perspective using validation rules.

308
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:37,073
They don&#39;t fit the setup of the validation rules.

309
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:43,540
So the data quality dashboard has, as I said,

310
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,290
like an overview of the data quality,

311
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,060
and this is an example.

312
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,060
So we have a favorite that monitors the overall timeliness.

313
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,850
This example is timeliness for the whole country.

314
00:19:00,850 --> 00:19:03,420
A province would obviously see the same thing

315
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,940
for their specific province.

316
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,490
And we have the one for completeness.

317
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:12,380
Then we look at the country as a whole

318
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:17,380
over a 12-month period to monitor it over time.

319
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,290
And then we also look for the country

320
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:24,710
at each specific province in the country

321
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,000
for the last three months.

322
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:32,000
If you look at these two dashboards, we read them together.

323
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:36,610
So this is the raw data that makes up the timeliness rate

324
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:40,260
and the raw data that makes up the completeness rate.

325
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,710
And you can see we use category option combos

326
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:47,690
for which data sets were actually completed

327
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:52,050
over which data sets were assigned to the country

328
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,100
in that particular month.

329
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,810
So we look at it over a six-month period,

330
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,810
and you can see the examples here

331
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,400
of how we use legend sets

332
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,400
even for our data quality indicators,

333
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,750
where green is we&#39;re happy

334
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:10,360
that they are completed on time.

335
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,560
The orange would represent that they need to improve,

336
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,543
and the red would mean that they&#39;re critical

337
00:20:17,543 --> 00:20:19,853
and they need to pay attention to this.

338
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,180
I also said earlier I would show you an example

339
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,300
of our HTML report that we use

340
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,830
for timeliness and completeness.

341
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:33,610
Once you&#39;ve selected your period and your org unit,

342
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:35,320
it will give you a summary here

343
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,070
of the reports that are expected,

344
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,620
the number that are compliant,

345
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,020
and the number that are non-compliant.

346
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,280
You can then go and look at it in depth

347
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,160
by clicking on this button to hide the compliant

348
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:52,120
and just focus on those that are not compliant.

349
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,130
You can also go and filter on any of these columns

350
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,460
to refine your search.

351
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:03,460
And you will see the expected reports for a given facility

352
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:06,340
or a given data set,

353
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,323
or even a given service point,

354
00:21:09,990 --> 00:21:14,990
and who actually completed and completed on time.

355
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,420
And then you can go and follow up on these facilities

356
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,270
before the due date to make sure.

357
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,980
So before the 10th of the month we focus on timeliness

358
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:29,470
and highlight to the district, sub-districts, facilities,

359
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:33,730
which facilities have still not completed before the 10th.

360
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:36,010
And we cut our losses after the 10th.

361
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,380
And then we focus on the ones that haven&#39;t completed

362
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,910
to try and at least get them to complete

363
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:43,817
before the 30th of the month.

364
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:50,730
This is an example of the program reporting rate,

365
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:53,133
which is on the Data Quality dashboard.

366
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,010
You can see that the levels of program reporting completed

367
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:00,810
are pretty high.

368
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:05,810
Our standard is that we expect 99.5% completeness

369
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:10,970
of that particular proxy data element.

370
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,020
And if they have any less than that,

371
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,123
they are highlighted for action.

372
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:20,060
And then this is the element reporting rate HTML report

373
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:25,060
that is used for the outreach teams.

374
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,210
Once you&#39;ve generated the report,

375
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:31,790
it will give you a summary of the compliance

376
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,840
for the particular level that you drew the report for.

377
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:40,690
In this case, it was for the provincial level.

378
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:44,730
And 94% of the facilities...

379
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:50,290
94% of the data elements that should have been reported on

380
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,910
were reported on.

381
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:56,910
You can then further go and look at it by facility

382
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,570
to see which of your facilities were the ones

383
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:05,160
that stopped you from getting your 100%.

384
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,500
This was done over a three-month period.

385
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,643
And you can see this facility

386
00:23:10,643 --> 00:23:13,530
did not submit everything in April,

387
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,290
and this one in May,

388
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:18,780
and these two just didn&#39;t submit their reports

389
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:20,233
at all for May.

390
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,370
You can then also go and look at it

391
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:29,260
per data element to see which of the data elements

392
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,240
were the ones that were not completed on time.

393
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,550
And obviously in this case,

394
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:38,530
all of the data elements were not completely captured

395
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,540
by every facility.

396
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:43,713
And it was a result of these two zeros in May.

397
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,890
Then we did the missing and outlier analysis

398
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:52,470
for our pre-submission data validation.

399
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,840
We do a comprehensive missing and outlier analysis,

400
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:01,810
and that is put into the pre-submission template

401
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,830
as an annexure.

402
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:07,160
And it is submitted to the lower level

403
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,020
for action on the missing data

404
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,260
and to deal with the outliers.

405
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,810
But in the data quality report that we do

406
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,490
for the National Department of Health,

407
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:21,490
we have selected the priority indicators for the country,

408
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:27,300
and we really just focus on the worst 15 facilities

409
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,453
over the 12-month period under review,

410
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,250
just to give an indication

411
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:41,470
of how that particular priority program is performing

412
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:44,523
and how bad the missing and outliers are.

413
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:50,520
Then for the validation rule violations,

414
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:53,710
this we really only do

415
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:57,060
as part of our pre-submission data validation.

416
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:01,400
This is an example extracted from

417
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,400
the pre-submission data validation template.

418
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,174
And for each of the areas that we assess,

419
00:25:10,174 --> 00:25:12,760
it follows the same principle, but in this case,

420
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,100
it&#39;s for validation rules

421
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:19,100
where you explain what the validation rule analysis is about

422
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,770
and why we do it.

423
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,850
Then you look at where it can be found.

424
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:29,840
And then we explain how you run the report.

425
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,390
And finally, we give an instruction

426
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:35,580
on how this report should be downloaded

427
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,210
and saved as an annexure in the pre-submission template

428
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:44,113
that goes back to the lower level for feedback.

429
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,956
For training and guidelines,

430
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:53,560
we do have an online training for daily data capturing

431
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,880
that is fairly popular.

432
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,810
And for this there is a learning manual

433
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,910
explaining what it&#39;s about,

434
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:02,443
why we do it, how we do it, et cetera.

435
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,770
We also have a data quality module

436
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:10,770
in our DHIS2 foundation course with its learner manual.

437
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:15,610
And we have a specific guideline for dashboard maintenance

438
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:18,600
because it is so important that the dashboards

439
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:22,910
are kept up to date in order for them to be relevant

440
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:25,100
for the use of that information

441
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,930
and to monitor the data quality that we have.

442
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,043
So we like them to be current,

443
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,550
and so they are maintained on a monthly basis.

444
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,290
And with every (indistinct) review,

445
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,690
these guidelines are also reviewed

446
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:44,780
to add in any new data elements,

447
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:48,560
indicators that have been selected

448
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,230
and to remove anything that is no longer relevant.

449
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,480
I&#39;m now going to just show you a few slides

450
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,060
on the progress we&#39;ve made over the years

451
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,153
since we introduced DHIS2.

452
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,660
This is with daily data capturing.

453
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:09,880
Obviously South Africa does have the same limitations

454
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,120
as many of the other countries in Africa,

455
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,120
and perhaps some of the Eastern countries,

456
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,880
where we have challenges with connectivity

457
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,130
at our facility level.

458
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:31,130
So when we started daily capturing 16/17 financial year,

459
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,480
we have made steady progress through the years,

460
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,480
and we&#39;re currently at 44% at now year that has just ended,

461
00:27:44,710 --> 00:27:46,293
the 19/20 year.

462
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,320
But there&#39;s ongoing pressure

463
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:55,560
to get more and more facilities capturing daily.

464
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,460
And so there is work being done

465
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:01,270
on trying to improve the connectivity at facilities,

466
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,253
but it is a limiting factor.

467
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,120
Our progress with our timeliness and completeness.

468
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,120
We started at around 39% for timeliness

469
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:17,270
and we&#39;re currently around 76%.

470
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:20,730
And for completeness, we started around 52%,

471
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:24,813
and we&#39;re now at just on 90% for that.

472
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,240
For program reporting, you can see that in 17/18

473
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,350
we really had no one on target

474
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,380
and it was a lot better in 18/19.

475
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:41,380
And then in 19/20 we had a lot more of the green.

476
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,810
So just to conclude then,

477
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:48,090
we have obviously made considerable progress

478
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:51,440
with improving data quality since we introduced DHIS,

479
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,977
both DHIS1 and DHIS2.

480
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:58,630
But maybe the take home message is that

481
00:28:58,630 --> 00:29:02,370
really it is very important to do monthly monitoring

482
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:04,830
and reporting on data quality.

483
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:09,080
Otherwise it tends to stagnate and sit at a certain level

484
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,460
or even regress.

485
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:15,090
So we are constantly looking at our data quality,

486
00:29:15,090 --> 00:29:16,750
monitoring it on a monthly basis,

487
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:21,750
and thinking of new ways to measure our data quality,

488
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,190
or improve the measures that we do have in the system.

489
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,193
And so that&#39;s it from South Africa. Thank you very much.

490
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,320
- [Moderator] Thank you so much, Jenny.

491
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,570
That was a really wonderful presentation. Really clear.

492
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,953
I would like to invite anyone from the.
