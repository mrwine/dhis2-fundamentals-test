0
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,863
- Move on to numerator relations,

1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,640
this numerator relations, what is numerator relations?

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:13,213
This is configuring what appears on consistency data.

3
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,760
And we already have a couple of things. Actually,

4
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,760
I&#39;m going to remove one of these so that I can show you

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,860
how it&#39;s done.

6
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:32,110
Um, so for now on numerator relations,

7
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,610
we only have the DPT one to three dropout rates.

8
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:39,623
That&#39;s all that&#39;s configured so far.

9
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:44,150
And if we look at the numerator relations page,

10
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,380
it comes with some defaults,

11
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:51,380
some default comparisons that the WHO recommends looking at,

12
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,070
for example,

13
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:58,280
comparing the first visit for anti-natal care to the first

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,280
dose of tetanus toxoid, or here is the first dose of,

15
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:08,370
of SP for preventive therapy for malaria in pregnancy.

16
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:15,760
And one of the comparators that they recommend is the DPT

17
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,200
one to three dropout rate.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,430
Notice how this is already filled in for you.

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:28,430
So the tool will automatically complete parts of the

20
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,840
numerator relations page.

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,620
If you have already configured numerator A and numerator B,

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,390
which, which we have.

23
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,210
So I haven&#39;t done anything to fill this in.

24
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,780
The tool has automatically filled this in.

25
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,040
You should check that it has done it correctly because

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,430
sometimes it, it misinterprets.

27
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:53,370
And then you, as we,

28
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:56,980
as we have seen on the dashboard that the dropout rate will

29
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,360
appear automatically.

30
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,360
So I&#39;m going to try to add this one

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:09,400
antenatal care compared to first visit for anti-natal care,

32
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:14,170
compared to the first dose of SP for IPT.

33
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,560
And when we, when we try to fill in the form, you see here,

34
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:28,040
here&#39;s the comparison, the type A is about equal B.

35
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,900
Well,

36
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:34,900
we can also select A is greater than B because often they,

37
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:36,583
not,

38
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:41,120
every woman is going to get SP for various reasons during

39
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:45,340
their first antenatal care visits or,

40
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:50,340
or even some subsequent visits that the first numerator has

41
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,190
been filled in automatically.

42
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,190
But then when we try to find the, the comparison numerator,

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,150
we look down the list and it&#39;s not there.

44
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:06,150
So you, what you have to do is,

45
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:10,700
is actually configure IPT one.

46
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,580
And fortunately there is in the ANC group,

47
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,490
there&#39;s a IPT first dose,

48
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,920
given at the primary health care units.

49
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,963
So once we configure this,

50
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:36,200
then the tool, when we go back to numerator relations,

51
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:41,200
it&#39;s automatically filled in and you can add things.

52
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:44,263
One that I like to add.

53
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,230
It&#39;s an interesting one.

54
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,280
If you think about it

55
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:54,250
ANC one compared to DPT one.

56
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,300
So how many of the pregnancies that present for their first

57
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,420
antenatal care visit go on to get their first dose of

58
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,920
DPT.

59
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,703
And let&#39;s say, choose A equals B.

60
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:19,410
We&#39;ve got short lists because we&#39;ve only configured a small

61
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,470
number of numerators,

62
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,023
and we&#39;re going to compare that and save it.

63
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,033
In fact,

64
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:30,750
I&#39;ll go back now and see what the dashboard looks like,

65
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:33,220
but having done that, you,

66
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,220
you see the table that that row of the table is filled in.

67
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,740
And now when we go to consistency data,

68
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:46,650
we&#39;ve got three different comparisons.

69
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:51,650
Remember our advice from the last session,

70
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,310
that&#39;s as interesting as it is to compare two different data

71
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,769
elements. This is the function of the data quality tool,

72
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:06,769
which is most demanding of the backend. And it slows down.

73
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:11,620
Sometimes this page will not load

74
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,848
It won&#39;t render and you&#39;ll find yourself waiting for a long

75
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:19,440
time. So it may be best if you find the page,

76
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,440
not loading to limit the data consistency to just a couple

77
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,890
of data comparisons,

78
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,700
but here&#39;s comparing,

79
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,710
here&#39;s the one we added.

80
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,750
Well, we added this one

81
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:41,433
and you see there&#39;s fairly good comparison.

82
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,270
And we added this one.

83
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:50,270
So indeed ANC1 does have a almost linear

84
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,603
relationship to first dose of Pinta vaccine.

85
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:01,010
Again, this, the only reason this works is because we,

86
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,710
we discussed yesterday, the idea of a steady state,

87
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:10,690
and this works because the number of pregnancies tends to be

88
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,353
roughly constant over time.

89
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:20,210
And if you have high levels of antenatal care coverage,

90
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,820
then most,

91
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:26,820
every pregnancy leads to a first antenatal care visits.

92
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:30,870
Most pregnancies result in a live birth.

93
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,430
And if you&#39;ve got high coverage with Pinta 1,

94
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:37,900
most live births received their first dose of Pinta

95
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,733
vaccine.

96
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:43,360
So this is always reassuring to see this kind of comparison.

97
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,520
And it works only if you&#39;ve got pretty high data quality,

98
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:54,010
pretty complete data, a few outliers,

99
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:57,450
high levels of coverage with antenatal care and

100
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:58,373
immunization.

101
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:04,480
And it&#39;s a fairly robust assessment of the quality of the

102
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,330
data system when you&#39;ve got this, this linear relationship.

103
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,443
But obviously there are some exceptions.

104
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,740
Let me again, I encourage anyone to raise their hand.

105
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:22,740
If you want me to pause, I, if not,

106
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,793
I&#39;m going to cover these thresholds.

107
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:32,390
Notice how tight the, the thresholds are here.

108
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:37,240
This is plus 10%. This is minus 10%.

109
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:40,390
And when the thresholds are so tight,

110
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:45,390
you&#39;ve got a large number of districts which have diamond

111
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:50,894
shaped dots because they fall outside of plus or minus 10%.

112
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,300
So,

113
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:59,300
and even this one where antenatal care is one is pretty

114
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,130
close to Pinta one.

115
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,640
And maybe we don&#39;t want to identify this as being a

116
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,820
suspicious value.

117
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:13,820
We want to accept districts that have at least this,

118
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,833
dot that is at least this close to the reference line.
