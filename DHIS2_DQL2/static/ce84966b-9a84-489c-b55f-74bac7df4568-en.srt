00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,540
- [Instructor] So another item is user management.

1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,520
And where user management has the most impact

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:10,130
on data quality is actually related to data access.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,010
So user roles, user groups and the authorities

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:16,690
that we then assign these roles.

5
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:18,680
So one thing is to keep on top of this,

6
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,030
because these authority sometimes change,

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,270
they get deprecated,

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,990
they don&#39;t really work in the way we intended over time

9
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:27,040
and keeping up-to-date on that

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,563
is not really the easiest thing to do.

11
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,070
But what are then the best practices for this?

12
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,620
So once again, I don&#39;t have the solutions

13
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,850
to a lot of these problems,

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,430
I think it&#39;s done differently in different places.

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:42,810
Certainly like everything else,

16
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,920
I always try to implement SOPs for this.

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,920
I will pull up an example of one

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,303
after I just kind of explain this a bit more.

19
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:55,110
But in a lot of places we could say the same thing

20
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,860
for users as we have for organization units,

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,500
decentralizing them becomes very challenging.

22
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,410
Decentralizing this function becomes very challenging,

23
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:06,960
particularly if you&#39;re having kind of top level expertise

24
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,410
in the system that you&#39;re implementing

25
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,780
and the ability then to manage users

26
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,040
is left to maybe a small group of people.

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,390
And there could be thousands of users in that system

28
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:17,623
that need to be managed.

29
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,463
We already talked about disabling, removing users.

30
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:25,933
This is very challenging just to leading any object.

31
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,540
But then, we wanna make sure we are organizing users

32
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:34,270
in some way, and then we have some methodology to do this.

33
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,670
So what can they view, what can they edit?

34
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,873
Maybe they can only see a subset of information.

35
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,860
And users also have an effect on user groups.

36
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:46,070
And user groups are very important actually

37
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,910
for this data access concept,

38
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,300
particularly when we&#39;re trying to do something

39
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,860
about sharing, because it&#39;s basically impossible to manage

40
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,580
sharing on a user level if you have thousands of users.

41
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,630
Even if it is possible,

42
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,580
theoretically, it&#39;s certainly not very practical.

43
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,430
So having these user groups there is quite important,

44
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,900
but they&#39;re often not there.

45
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,800
And if that&#39;s the case then, then what do you do?

46
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,830
So, user management is really important for data access.

47
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,650
I suggest proactive approaches are taken

48
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:20,130
when kind of implementing this initially,

49
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,990
many of us are past that point

50
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,580
and there&#39;s already lots of issues.

51
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,770
So, there has to be then procedures in place

52
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:29,150
in order to kind of handle this a bit more

53
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,310
because there are certain things that are not easily done

54
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:34,410
through the maintenance interface.

55
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:37,760
Some things you have to approach in a different way.

56
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,020
So just thinking about how we transfer these skills

57
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,360
over to the teams we&#39;re working with,

58
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,150
in order to allow them to control data access

59
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,780
in a more meaningful way that makes sense to them

60
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,483
based on their program&#39;s needs.

61
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,860
So here&#39;s another example,

62
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,040
standard operating procedure for creating users.

63
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,770
Now you might&#39;ve noticed at this point in time,

64
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,410
that I don&#39;t use any screenshots actually to create my SOPs,

65
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:08,240
and that is mainly because the user interface

66
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,150
keeps changing, the authorities keep changing.

67
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,510
So if you&#39;re trying to maintain this over time,

68
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,910
becomes quite challenging.

69
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,620
But the idea is also to make this as short

70
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,220
and understandable as possible.

71
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,320
So kinda make it straight to the point,

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,440
and just specify what people need to do

73
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,680
when they want to create a user with certain rights

74
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,240
in their system.

75
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,680
But this is another, there&#39;s not a,

76
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,690
there might be some problems with this approach of course,

77
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,950
but it&#39;s another way to kind of help things move along.

78
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:43,570
So I posted this and you can have a look at this as well,

79
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,300
basically just goes over what roles they should be assigned,

80
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,500
and which user groups they should be assigned

81
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,650
to you essentially

82
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:53,590
because this becomes a larger problem obviously

83
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:56,140
with access to the data as we have been discussing.

84
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,670
So we also have the issue of sharing.

85
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:05,810
And sharing is directly related to our user management.

86
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:08,660
So when user groups are well-defined,

87
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,800
then we can apply sharing to our sets of metadata.

88
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,180
But like I said, that&#39;s often not the case.

89
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:17,580
You might not have a lot of well-defined user groups

90
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:18,880
in the system.

91
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,230
And this is still kind of,

92
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,300
this concept has been around for some time,

93
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,930
but this whole idea of sharing both for tracker

94
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,130
and for aggregate is still quite challenging

95
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,240
in a lot of places making sure that the right people

96
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,730
have access to this data.

97
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,050
And more so then,

98
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,430
maybe this is something we set up initially,

99
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,600
we help people to set up initially.

100
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,390
But then what happens after that?

101
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,170
Long-term management of sharing

102
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,470
becomes very challenging, because there are no tools

103
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:47,390
to manage sharing well in DHIS2.

104
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,420
So we can kind of click on one item,

105
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,140
click on one data element and then share it, right?

106
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,620
Through the user interface.

107
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:57,796
But that&#39;s not practical, right?

108
00:04:57,796 --> 00:05:00,700
There&#39;s no way you can manage sharing in a large system

109
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,320
like this, like a lot of the implementations

110
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,850
that we&#39;re working with.

111
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,840
So, what do we do then, we script a lot of this, right?

112
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,164
We come up with with different solutions,

113
00:05:12,164 --> 00:05:15,870
there&#39;s different solutions out there that can be used

114
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,270
for scripting this process.

115
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,780
We come up with some way to do this ourselves,

116
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,410
and then maybe we document it at that snapshot,

117
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,930
at that point in time.

118
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:27,780
But then what happens as new programs are added,

119
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,743
new data elements are added, new data sets are added?

120
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,400
How do we share then all of these items?

121
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,380
How do we transfer this over then to countries as well?

122
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,380
Because there&#39;s no real good mechanism right now to do this

123
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,700
through the user interface that would make it easy

124
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,460
for countries to learn how to do sharing correctly.

125
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,290
So that&#39;s what we sometimes see it being done so poorly,

126
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,450
because there&#39;s not really a good mechanism for it there

127
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,330
at the moment, this is something we can fix, right?

128
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,430
Often we can go in there

129
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,480
and we can fix the sharing actually.

130
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,350
We can have a great influence there in helping countries

131
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,940
to fix this problem.

132
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,300
But the main challenge is then,

133
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,890
how do we have countries kind of take this up

134
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:09,893
to do a lot of these functions and operations on their own?

135
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:16,300
So here&#39;s an example of an actual system

136
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,030
where sharing has gone completely wrong.

137
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,410
It had over 6,000 dashboards,

138
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:25,870
nearly 3,000 of them had nothing on them,

139
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,440
the majority of them were completely private,

140
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,100
just private to that particular user,

141
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,153
so they were serving no function.

142
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,870
You had a couple shared with individual users,

143
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,200
you had a couple of maybe shared

144
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,200
with a couple of user groups,

145
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,940
there were a couple that were public.

146
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,220
And then we go through all the analytical objects as well,

147
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:46,044
all their favorites, all their data element groups,

148
00:06:46,044 --> 00:06:48,810
all the indicator groups and categories, et cetera.

149
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,740
So when we have this amount of metadata in our system,

150
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,340
you can see there&#39;s obviously other problems here

151
00:06:57,340 --> 00:07:00,610
unrelated to sharing all kinds of general problems

152
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,640
that we&#39;ve been discussing.

153
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,800
Maybe a complete lack of coordination,

154
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,350
lack of procedures in terms of adding metadata

155
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,930
to the system.

156
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,010
But then when we go to actually,

157
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,470
dive down into this a bit further,

158
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,790
because of the way that this is configured and shared,

159
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,300
it&#39;s going to make it extremely difficult

160
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,633
to find what is required to analyze your data.

161
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,610
This has a direct impact on the ability

162
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:27,610
to kind of output quality, sorry,

163
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:29,320
create quality outputs.

164
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,320
Because if I can&#39;t even find what I need,

165
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,490
then it&#39;s going to be extremely challenging

166
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:38,500
to create anything that is useful for my needs,

167
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,330
that I can even start to begin to review

168
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:43,050
the potential data quality issues.

169
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,070
And then, how do I handle that if I can&#39;t even see

170
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,010
what I want,

171
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,013
or if there&#39;s just so much overwhelming information,

172
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:54,530
if I have 83 public data element groups

173
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,010
with over 13,000 public data elements,

174
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,820
finding what I need is going to be extremely challenging.

175
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,660
So in some cases,

176
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:07,390
we want to share everything with everyone, right?

177
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,680
We want to kind of, as a data repository in particular,

178
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,410
we want to promote this type of sharing

179
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,700
of information across programs.

180
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,280
But at the same time, there might be instances

181
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,060
where we need to narrow what we&#39;re sharing

182
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:25,400
and make this work a bit more,

183
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,890
so people can see what they need to quickly,

184
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:31,420
find what they need to quickly and not just have access

185
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,160
to everything all at once.

186
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,042
So, there are two items here.

187
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:39,430
We can influence this more because we can go in there

188
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,090
and clean it up.

189
00:08:41,090 --> 00:08:45,620
But at the same time, how do we then transfer the skills?

190
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,140
That&#39;s kind of the question I&#39;m posing.

191
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,180
How do we then transfer a lot of this over to countries

192
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,860
where, because we&#39;re going to script.

193
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,930
Cleaning up something like my example here,

194
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:57,970
we wouldn&#39;t do anything manually, right?

195
00:08:57,970 --> 00:08:59,210
We would script all of this,

196
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:01,480
we would find other ways, other solutions,

197
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,583
to make this process a bit more automated.

198
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,690
So what I&#39;d like to do is kind of initiate

199
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,400
a bit of discussion around this topic,

200
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,900
because some of you might have solutions

201
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,700
that I&#39;ve not been able to think of obviously.

202
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,533
As I mentioned,

203
00:09:17,533 --> 00:09:19,680
I didn&#39;t have the solution to all these problems,

204
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,650
I&#39;m able to identify a lot of them

205
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:24,160
and make long-term adjustments

206
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,030
to actually fix some of these things,

207
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,500
but nothing immediate in some cases.

208
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,910
So, if you have kinda more immediate solutions

209
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,950
or different ways to handle these,

210
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,430
certainly interested in hearing from you.

211
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:39,660
So when you assign programs and datasets

212
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:41,233
to organization units,

213
00:09:42,535 --> 00:09:45,640
what considerations have you made in the past,

214
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,790
particularly as it relates to things like,

215
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,880
completeness of information and appropriate access

216
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,440
to those programs and datasets?

217
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,350
What are some approaches that have worked

218
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,460
when dealing with user management?

219
00:09:57,460 --> 00:10:00,160
In particular, decentralized user management

220
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,010
and making sure people have the right access

221
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,063
to the right pieces of information?

222
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,350
How have you dealt with countries managing mass sharing?

223
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,410
Has this something that you&#39;ve been successful in imparting

224
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:15,130
to countries so they can manage this on their own,

225
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:15,963
or is this something

226
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:17,690
where you were still kind of heavily involved

227
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,240
with supporting due to the nature of your relationship

228
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,160
with that country and the kind of inability

229
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,520
that we have right now with DHIS2 tools

230
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,853
to do this easily?

231
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,930
So, have you been able to successfully decentralize

232
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:34,010
any of these roles?

233
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,060
That would also be very interesting to hear from you all.

234
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,710
And how have you approached capacity building

235
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,860
around these functions?

236
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,360
Because I think one of the main challenges is,

237
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,460
we&#39;re going to keep seeing this poor design

238
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:49,350
if we&#39;re not able to have others basically learn

239
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:53,440
how to do these various functionalities within their system.

240
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,270
If it&#39;s always his group supporting this,

241
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:58,640
then that&#39;s not sustainable.

242
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,910
That&#39;s not a sustainable approach,

243
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,410
that&#39;s not what we want to do.

244
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,780
It might be the case where the tools

245
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,970
need some significant modification in order to support these

246
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,000
and make these things easier to do.

247
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,750
But in the interim, we need some placeholder.

248
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,110
So, I&#39;m just curious how you&#39;ve kind of dealt

249
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:18,840
with a lot of these in the countries you&#39;re working with.

250
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,960
So we&#39;ve created a discussion board

251
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,500
for this particular topic

252
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,450
just to directly underneath within this module here.

253
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:27,730
And I&#39;d be really interested

254
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,530
if you could kind of just post some of these,

255
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,920
some answers to these questions.

256
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,380
Just to have a think about it

257
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,050
and post some responses to these.

258
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:38,140
If this is not something you have a lot of experience with,

259
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:39,850
don&#39;t worry, maybe you just read

260
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,580
some of the replies from others,

261
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,810
but this is something maybe we can come back to

262
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:47,163
when we have our live discussion later on.
