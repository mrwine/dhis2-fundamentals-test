<h3>What's in this Module?</h3> 
<p class= "text">Now that you’ve looked at the WHO Data Quality Tool, what other Data Quality features are available in DHIS2? </p> 
<p class= "text">In this module you will explore <b>how validation rules and predictors can be used to ensure data quality in DHIS2</b>, and you’ll also look at the <b>Data Quality App within DHIS2</b>. First, Scott Russpatrick will start by exploring how you can use Validation Rules and how they can be configured to notify you and your team of any Data Quality issues. After that, Scott will show you how Standard Deviation Predictors can be used to identify outliers in your data sets. </p>  
<p class= "text">Then, Norah Stoops from HISP South Africa will introduce you to the DHIS2 Data Quality App. You’ll start by looking at how you can <b>set up validation rules inside of the application</b>. Next, you’ll look at <b>how you can use the Data Quality App to conduct a Desk Review of Data Quality</b>, with an example of how South Sudan conducted its own Desk Review. Finally, you’ll look at <b>how Min/Max values can be used to improve your Data Quality</b>.</p>   

<h3>Learning objectives</h3>
<p class= "text">By the end of this module you will be able to:</p>
<p class= "text"> <ul>
     <li>Identify how Validation Rules can be used to improve Data Quality </li>
    <li>Create Validation Rules that trigger notifications when Data Quality issues arise </li>
    <li>Create Standard Deviation predictors can be used to identify outliers</li>
    <li>Indicate the advantages of using  the DHIS2 Data Quality App </li>
    <li>Understand what Min/Max values are in the Data Quality App</li>
    <li>Configure Min/Max values in the Data Quality App</li>
</ul></p>

<h3>How will you be evaluated?</h3>
<p class= "text">In this Module, you’ll be assessed through a number of different exercises, focusing on Validation Rules, Min/Max analysis, and Standard Deviation Predictors. These exercises will contribute 10% to your final grade. </p>
<h3>How long will this module take?</h3>
<p class= "text">This module should take about <b>4 hours 20 min</b> to complete.</p>
