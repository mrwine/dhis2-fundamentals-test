00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:02,490
- [Instructor] All right, so now I have the pleasure

1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,750
of taking us through some of the basics of data quality.

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,790
Again, a lot of this is gonna be kind of foundational

3
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:08,630
to many of you.

4
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:09,910
Many of you, like I said,

5
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:11,690
could probably give this presentation yourself,

6
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:13,720
but I just wanna make sure that we all appreciate

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,440
all the different components of data quality

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,540
so that we are just starting off on the same page,

9
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,323
singing the same song, so to speak.

10
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,083
Let me just progress through the slide here.

11
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:28,670
Okay, so what are we doing in this presentation?

12
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:31,430
We&#39;re gonna start off with some definitions of data quality,

13
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:32,830
many different definitions out there,

14
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,780
we&#39;re gonna kind of give you the textbook definition

15
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:35,803
as we understand it.

16
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,720
Some implications of different data quality checks,

17
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,560
some causes of some data quality issues,

18
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,160
and then I&#39;ll quickly just point out

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,780
some strategies to address them.

20
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,380
Certainly not a comprehensive overview

21
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,920
of every single thing about data quality,

22
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,028
but we are going to just lay the foundation

23
00:00:51,028 --> 00:00:52,653
here in this presentation.

24
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,830
So why is it important to address data quality?

25
00:00:56,830 --> 00:01:00,730
This is a no-brainer, hopefully rhetorical question,

26
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,330
but what I want you to appreciate

27
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,490
is that data quality

28
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,060
and data use are connected,

29
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:13,500
and we call this the virtuous data cycle, okay?

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,780
So we have data quality,

31
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,574
and we have poor data quality, we have good data quality.

32
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:21,060
You can see poor on the left, good on the right.

33
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,640
Then we also have data use,

34
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,340
we have low data use and high data use,

35
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,840
low on the left, high on the right.

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,210
And what we have to appreciate

37
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,730
is that these are completely linked together.

38
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,850
Data quality and data use are inseparable.

39
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:40,860
You cannot have high data use with poor data quality,

40
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:41,900
it&#39;s just not really possible,

41
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,810
we&#39;ve not seen any evidence that that is possible,

42
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,030
to have high data use and poor data quality.

43
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:51,960
We have seen examples where you have good data quality,

44
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,950
but low data use.

45
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,850
Now that is possible.

46
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,610
Unfortunately, you know, many countries or many projects

47
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,400
put a lot of emphasis on having high data quality,

48
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,050
but then ultimately people don&#39;t use the data.

49
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,920
That&#39;s a separate issue.

50
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,860
And there&#39;s another academy for that as well

51
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,190
on data use practices.

52
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,780
But the important thing to appreciate here

53
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,470
in this virtuous data cycle

54
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,480
is that we have to have good data quality

55
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,340
to have high data use.

56
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,270
We just won&#39;t ever get data use there

57
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,800
if we have poor data quality.

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,680
And if we do have good data quality

59
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,210
and we do have high data use,

60
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,410
we can start to do all these things

61
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,130
that everyone&#39;s always talking about:

62
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,037
data-driven actions and decisions,

63
00:02:31,037 --> 00:02:33,090
ownership of data, data cultures,

64
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,210
data being actually used in our routine daily practices,

65
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,800
people consulting data prior to making decisions,

66
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,660
prior to planning processes.

67
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,350
And people are asking for data,

68
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:46,600
people want data throughout your entire hierarchy,

69
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,400
your organization, your project

70
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,070
because they know that it&#39;s good quality, it&#39;s reliable,

71
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:55,190
and it&#39;s going to make the decisions

72
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,560
that they have to have more impact.

73
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,077
So we get data demand.

74
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,420
So why do you think that data is of poor quality?

75
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,770
There are many, many reasons for this.

76
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,480
And actually one of your assignments later today

77
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,650
is to tell us some of the reasons

78
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:16,350
why in your country or your project,

79
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:19,300
you think that you have some data quality issues.

80
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,220
One of the major ones,

81
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,620
the first bullet point here is poor form design,

82
00:03:23,752 --> 00:03:24,940
or poor system design,

83
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:26,050
or high reporting burden.

84
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,060
Just you put up many different kind of infrastructural,

85
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,680
or you make the tools that people need to use

86
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,080
to report data or to even visualize data hard to use.

87
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,363
If you make the tool itself hard to use

88
00:03:40,363 --> 00:03:41,760
then people who don&#39;t use it,

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,860
if they don&#39;t use it,

90
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:44,560
then when they do have to use it,

91
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
they&#39;re going to struggle to understand it,

92
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,810
they&#39;re gonna struggle to fully utilize it,

93
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:53,610
and that&#39;s gonna result in oftentimes poor data quality.

94
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,873
The second bullet point,

95
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:59,050
and this is really very kind of pervasive

96
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,410
in many countries,

97
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,520
is that people do not feel accountable for their data.

98
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,920
People don&#39;t receive any feedback when they submit data,

99
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,210
they don&#39;t receive notifications

100
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:11,110
that their data is being used or being checked,

101
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,210
especially thinking about the folks at district level

102
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:15,663
or a health facility level,

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,700
how much feedback are they getting on data quality?

104
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,330
In many places, it&#39;s very, very little.

105
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:24,250
They&#39;re also seeing that their data is not being used,

106
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,560
they don&#39;t see any decisions coming from higher level,

107
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,530
they&#39;re not being encouraged

108
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,760
to make decisions off their data.

109
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,080
So people don&#39;t feel accountable for it,

110
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,590
people just kind of think that it&#39;s just a thing

111
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,423
that I have to do,

112
00:04:32,423 --> 00:04:35,410
I just put it in and then it&#39;s gone, right?

113
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:38,140
Never to be concerned about it again.

114
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,501
And without accountability

115
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:41,090
people wouldn&#39;t put a lot of effort

116
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,690
into making sure that what they&#39;re doing is correct.

117
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:45,763
Third bullet point here,

118
00:04:45,763 --> 00:04:47,030
and I already kind of touched on this

119
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,107
is that there&#39;s very little ownership of data.

120
00:04:49,107 --> 00:04:50,500
And the ownership of the data

121
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,960
needs to be principally at the lowest levels,

122
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,900
the people who are actually generating the data,

123
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,920
community health workers, facility staff, district staff,

124
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,560
these are the people who are actually

125
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,690
providing the services, filling out the forms,

126
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:07,710
and in many countries, putting that data into DHIS2

127
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,320
or into the reporting tools.

128
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,910
And if they don&#39;t feel ownership of the data,

129
00:05:12,910 --> 00:05:15,490
then they are not going to do a good job with this.

130
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:17,030
And that&#39;s kind of just the bottom line,

131
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,320
they have to appreciate why their data is important,

132
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,640
why collecting the data and putting it in is important,

133
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,670
and they need to say that, &quot;Yes, this is my data,

134
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,360
it represents the work that I do and I stand by it.

135
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,100
I say that it is accurate.&quot;

136
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,000
And in order to get to that place,

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,820
they need to see people using it,

138
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,200
they need to be encouraged to use it,

139
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,020
they need to be given the tools to use it,

140
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,240
they need to receive feedback.

141
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,350
That&#39;s how you generate a sense of ownership.

142
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:45,320
The last bullet point,

143
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,760
and this is probably one of the biggest reasons

144
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,730
that data is actually poor data quality

145
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:51,743
is that data is not trusted.

146
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,420
There&#39;s many countries that I&#39;ve worked in

147
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,880
where people just assume that the data quality is bad.

148
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,340
And they just assume this

149
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:03,440
because they don&#39;t actually have any insights into...

150
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,830
Or they&#39;re not able to see

151
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,530
where the data quality issues are.

152
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:10,370
They just know from some kind of anecdotal experience

153
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,620
or some kind of process they went through

154
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,230
that some data shouldn&#39;t be trusted,

155
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,360
and if we just don&#39;t worry about that data,

156
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,600
then we can kind of go about our lives.

157
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,770
Well, if we build a culture of data not being trusted,

158
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:25,570
then we are not gonna see any data quality improvements.

159
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,620
And one of the best ways to make sure

160
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:33,520
that we actually get to working on data trust issues

161
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,920
is we start to show people

162
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,940
where the data quality issues are.

163
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,140
We start to use tools, dashboards, alerts, notifications,

164
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,170
all the various things that we&#39;re gonna show you this week

165
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,370
to actually push data quality issues to the user

166
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,440
so that the data quality becomes very transparent.

167
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,470
People will say, &quot;Yes, there&#39;s a problem here,

168
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,920
I can do something about it.&quot;

169
00:06:56,294 --> 00:07:00,130
And that&#39;s really fundamentally necessary

170
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:01,970
is that people see the data quality issues,

171
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,680
people feel that they can do something about it,

172
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,593
and that starts to build data trust.

173
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,993
How do we define good data quality?

174
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,713
Well, the most basic sense,

175
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,323
data is of high quality when it&#39;s fit for its intended use.

176
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,030
Can I use it for my operations,

177
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:25,720
my decision-making, my planning, my policies?

178
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,480
You know, do I have standard operating procedures

179
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,710
built around it?

180
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,420
You know, when data is routinely utilized in these ways,

181
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:36,163
we can say that your data is of high enough quality.

182
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:42,320
More often than not, it&#39;s just a data quality

183
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,390
is defined as good when we are able to make it fit,

184
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,370
make it fit for purpose, right?

185
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:50,023
Make it something that we can reliably depend upon.

186
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:55,890
Let&#39;s quickly cover some of the data quality dimensions now,

187
00:07:55,890 --> 00:07:58,933
the first one that we want to go through is completeness.

188
00:08:00,086 --> 00:08:03,420
Completeness is, did we get all the data in

189
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,813
that we needed to get in?

190
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,300
Do we have all the health facilities reporting this month?

191
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,400
And if we do is that data...

192
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,430
Is that enough to be able to use, to make a decision?

193
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,980
You know, you can&#39;t make decisions if you only have

194
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,070
let&#39;s say 50% of your health facilities

195
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,070
reporting every month, right?

196
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:22,590
You need to have high completeness,

197
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:24,170
you need to have all the data coming in

198
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,490
that you expect to come in.

199
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,323
This is easily measurable in DHIS2.

200
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,320
The next thing is timeliness,

201
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,520
is all the data there when we need it to be there,

202
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,090
when we expect it to be there?

203
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:41,090
If we are receiving data from many, many months ago,

204
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:43,550
maybe that data is not even relevant anymore,

205
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:44,560
maybe things have changed,

206
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,800
maybe you&#39;re getting malaria data before the rainy season.

207
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,230
Is that useful if you&#39;re in the middle of the raIny season?

208
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,230
Probably not.

209
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,920
So your immediate decisions and actions

210
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,830
are not gonna be based upon this old data.

211
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,280
So we need the data to be coming in

212
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,680
when it&#39;s supposed to be coming in,

213
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,840
and we need to build our operating procedures

214
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,570
and our processes around the most relevant

215
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:07,573
and up-to-date data.

216
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,570
Again, this is something

217
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,370
that we can easily measure in DHIS2.

218
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,420
Consistency, this is one that a lot of people

219
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,070
can easily forget about,

220
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:22,060
is our data reflected the same information

221
00:09:23,013 --> 00:09:25,890
across all the various tools that we&#39;re using?

222
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:29,520
So if you go down to the facility, is that registry,

223
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,660
that number that&#39;s recorded in that registry,

224
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,010
is it also the number that I&#39;m seeing in DHIS2?

225
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,510
Maybe you have some kind of patient tracking system, right?

226
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,530
Is the data that&#39;s in that patient tracking system

227
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,240
also the same as the aggregated numbers

228
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,360
I&#39;m seeing in DHIS2?

229
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,490
We need to be able to check

230
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,350
all of these various reporting forms,

231
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:49,183
and we need to say,

232
00:09:49,183 --> 00:09:53,660
&quot;Is the data consistent across all these various sources?&quot;

233
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,240
We also need to think about consistency over time,

234
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,720
is the data following a similar trend

235
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,000
that we expect to see year after year?

236
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,960
For example, with a lot of seasonal diseases,

237
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:06,210
we expect this very specific trend over time,

238
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,470
year after year, after year,

239
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,140
it is the data following that trend?

240
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,590
We consider that consistency.

241
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,880
Conformity, this is one that is easily...

242
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,160
We stumble over quite a lot.

243
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,240
So is the data following a set of standard definitions?

244
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:26,100
A good example of this is when it&#39;s in the form design

245
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,823
or system use,

246
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,300
many countries have a lot of different ways

247
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,520
of naming the same thing.

248
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:36,470
So malaria versus confirmed malaria, for example,

249
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:38,320
which one do we use?

250
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,580
Which one is the data that we should be consistently using?

251
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,740
Which one is the one that it&#39;s actually reported on?

252
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:47,400
Sometimes it&#39;s fairly not clear

253
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,871
on which data should be used.

254
00:10:51,871 --> 00:10:54,954
(indistinct chatter)

255
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,060
The next one is accuracy,

256
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:03,290
does the data reflect the real-world events?

257
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,970
You know, is that number of patients that was actually seen

258
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:10,150
during the antenatal care visits,

259
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:12,500
is that the actual number that gets into DHIS2?

260
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:18,030
Integrity, so this is kind of our internal

261
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,501
consistency traceability.

262
00:11:20,501 --> 00:11:23,584
(indistinct chatter)

263
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:31,950
So the integrity here is talking about can we...

264
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:34,620
Sorry, a little bit of disruption here in the room.

265
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,790
The integrity here is a little bit about,

266
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:39,080
can we look at the data over time

267
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,780
and making sure that we are able to trace it back

268
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,420
to its original source?

269
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,253
Right?

270
00:11:45,253 --> 00:11:47,270
So we see the high level of data at the very top,

271
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,620
the outcome impact indicators,

272
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,780
can we go down the hierarchy?

273
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,450
Can we go down to the most granular place

274
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:54,010
and say, &quot;Yes, this is consistent

275
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,510
throughout the whole process.&quot;

276
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,070
One big example of this is like,

277
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,420
if you actually have patients in your database,

278
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:05,880
you are maybe into collecting individual patient data,

279
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:08,780
and do you have multiple patients for the same person

280
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,800
recorded in your database?

281
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,450
This is becoming increasingly common.

282
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,900
You need to be able to be able to perform

283
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,720
these kinds of data quality checks as well,

284
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,780
to make sure you&#39;re not like double counting patients,

285
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,980
which would then skew your aggregated data,

286
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,390
which ultimately can skew off your entire impact

287
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:25,603
and outcome indicators.

288
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,880
Let&#39;s just look at some quick examples from the real world.

289
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,800
So, first of all, on completeness,

290
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,200
this is the DHIS2 data set completeness app,

291
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,400
we&#39;re gonna cover this app,

292
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:47,400
but this is a picture of some Sierra Leone generated data.

293
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:51,330
And you can see that looking at completeness,

294
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:55,590
we have the actual reports divided by the expected reports.

295
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:59,010
And then we can see the number of...

296
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,760
And we can see what percentage of reports

297
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,260
are actually incomplete,

298
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,140
and we can see the number of reports

299
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,913
that reported on time as well.

300
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,640
This is the app that like I said, we&#39;ll go through,

301
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:12,613
and you can quickly start to see those facilities,

302
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,080
the completeness by different aggregation levels.

303
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,580
So national level, district level, regional level,

304
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:20,870
and go all the way down to individual facilities

305
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:21,963
if you need to.

306
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:26,720
Timeliness, DHIS2 has,

307
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,970
if you&#39;re reporting an aggregated data,

308
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,180
DHIS2 has a really good tool for timeliness,

309
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,240
and that is in the dataset configuration,

310
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,900
you can set the number of days after the period

311
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,520
that you wanna qualify that data for being timely.

312
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:44,520
So for example, you can say 15 days and what you see here,

313
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:50,260
and that says that this data has 15 days

314
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:55,660
to be entered for the previous period

315
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,233
for it to be considered timely.

316
00:13:58,593 --> 00:14:01,140
And if it&#39;s entered after that 15 days,

317
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,350
then it&#39;s considered late,

318
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,240
it&#39;s not considered timely or current data.

319
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,250
And that can be a data quality check that you build in.

320
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,390
You can either say, &quot;Don&#39;t allow it,&quot;

321
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,730
or you can say, &quot;Allow it,&quot;

322
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,980
but flag it and we need to follow up on that.

323
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,810
Consistency is a good one here,

324
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:17,780
to give you a bit of an example,

325
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,940
we&#39;re actually not looking at DHIS2 data here,

326
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,520
but we&#39;re just looking at it from an example

327
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,520
from the 2016 Zambia population,

328
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,990
where there was an NGO, PATH,

329
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:31,650
that had population figures,

330
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,370
and then there was the District Health Office

331
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,720
that had population figures,

332
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,670
and then there was a population figure

333
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:39,033
provided by the Central Statistics Office.

334
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,370
And here you can actually see (clears throat) excuse me,

335
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,280
the District Health Office population figure

336
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,920
was significantly different than the NGOs population figure.

337
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,410
Now, which one is used?

338
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:55,520
Which one is used and which indicator?

339
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,853
How are we able to monitor and check for this?

340
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:02,410
It&#39;s important that we actually have some processes

341
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,347
to appreciate how the data is consistent,

342
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:08,340
like the same numbers should be consistent

343
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,820
across various sources,

344
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,440
and it should be relayed and communicated over time

345
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,400
and be consistent,

346
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,090
and again, following those trends over time.

347
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:17,923
The trends over time is something

348
00:15:17,923 --> 00:15:19,700
that we&#39;re gonna really take a look at

349
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,240
in the WHO Data Quality App.

350
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,340
So consistency over time,

351
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,900
if it&#39;s a little bit bit vague now

352
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,360
it will become crystal clear to you

353
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,623
in the next few sessions.

354
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,930
Conformity, conformity is a good one here.

355
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,040
This is actually going back

356
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,990
to kind of our design considerations.

357
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:34,960
So here we&#39;re looking, actually,

358
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,530
a picture of a data entry form, right?

359
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:41,780
And you can see though, what we&#39;ve zoomed in on here

360
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,160
is the number of vaccine doses

361
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,490
discarded due to...

362
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,830
And then you have the various vaccines,

363
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,890
you have an expiration date, that&#39;s fine,

364
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,503
but then you have a VVM change.

365
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,943
And what is supposed to be entered here?

366
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:58,933
Is this clear?

367
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,630
Is anyone actually really sure?

368
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,860
So one person wrote no,

369
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:04,260
and then there&#39;s a bunch of tick marks.

370
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,520
Is this counting anything?

371
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:09,250
How is this going to be reported into the DHIS2?

372
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,660
This is very confusing.

373
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:12,629
And I think the important thing to appreciate

374
00:16:12,629 --> 00:16:15,840
is that if you allow it to use...

375
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,350
You know, if the person entering the data

376
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,150
is making an interpretation about how the data

377
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:23,260
should actually be filled out on the original form,

378
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,870
then you&#39;re gonna have very poor conformity,

379
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,020
people are gonna be doing different things.

380
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,010
Accuracy, another example from the field,

381
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,470
a data entry form.

382
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:39,700
And let&#39;s take a look at that second row there,

383
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:43,064
which is IPT first doses.

384
00:16:43,064 --> 00:16:46,080
And here you see that it&#39;s a tick form,

385
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:49,010
it was a common form you see out in the field

386
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,880
where they&#39;ve ticked off

387
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:53,120
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

388
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,250
But then they have to do a manual aggregation of this,

389
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,240
and if you follow that all the way over to the right,

390
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,210
you see they&#39;ve written two.

391
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:02,910
Well, they&#39;ve ticked off seven,

392
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,070
but they&#39;ve aggregated to two.

393
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:05,993
Is that accurate?

394
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,940
Who knows? (laughs)

395
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,270
I mean, it could be seven, it could be two,

396
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,250
it&#39;s probably seven if they&#39;ve filled out

397
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,290
the form correctly,

398
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,500
but somehow they did a manual aggregation to two,

399
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,660
and what goes into DHIS2?

400
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,440
Probably that two.

401
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,200
And so the accuracy needs to go down

402
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:23,220
all the way to the individual reporting forms.

403
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,780
And you need to be able to check for this

404
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,080
in your standard operating procedures

405
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,730
and your routine processes,

406
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,320
the supervision and support that you&#39;re giving

407
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,730
to health facilities and community health workers

408
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,933
to be able to check for these kinds of things.

409
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,130
Oh yeah, sorry, just highlighting the points here.

410
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:39,970
Another one here,

411
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,310
they&#39;ve got a total number of deliveries,

412
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,080
they&#39;ve ticked off four of these,

413
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,913
and then what do they do?

414
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:45,746
They put a zero.

415
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,720
Integrity is a very important...

416
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,510
Integrity is essentially are we able to track

417
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,740
the changes in the data over time

418
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,890
for a single data value?

419
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,440
And are we able to have processes

420
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,440
to be able to see if a value is changed,

421
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,370
who changed it,

422
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,730
and potentially follow up with them, why they changed it.

423
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,010
And here you can actually see,

424
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:12,530
and Nora is gonna take us through this

425
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,100
is the integrity checks

426
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,570
within DHIS2 that the audit trail

427
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:21,750
within each individual data element.

428
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:25,193
And here you are able to that change over time.

429
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,980
All right, a few key points here

430
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,640
to wrap us up on the session.

431
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:34,150
The first one is that data quality issues

432
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:36,350
are a fact of life.

433
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,307
Everyone is saying,

434
00:18:37,307 --> 00:18:40,040
&quot;Oh, I&#39;ve got so many data quality issues,

435
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,420
how do I get rid of my data quality issues?&quot;

436
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,130
That&#39;s kind of the wrong question to ask.

437
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:46,890
We have to appreciate that data quality issues

438
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:48,483
are going to happen.

439
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,660
Every information system that I&#39;ve worked with,

440
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,020
I think that anyone here has worked with,

441
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,100
they have outliers,

442
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,370
people put in crazy numbers sometimes,

443
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,143
usually data entry mistakes.

444
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:03,040
Outliers happen, it&#39;s a fact of life,

445
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,650
data entry errors happen, absolute fact of life.

446
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,130
Validation alerts are going to be triggered,

447
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,040
you&#39;re never going to...

448
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,360
If you really have clear, well-defined validation rules,

449
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,580
there&#39;s probably never a week that will go by

450
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,770
that you don&#39;t have some validation

451
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,710
notifications being triggered.

452
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:20,290
Fact of life.

453
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,410
Fraudulent data, people make up data, it does happen.

454
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:29,410
Many countries incentivize data to be reported on time,

455
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:33,210
more than they incentivized data to be reported accurately.

456
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,240
What does that mean?

457
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,210
That means that people really feel a lot of pressure

458
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:38,160
to get their data in on time,

459
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,730
but because the data is not being used,

460
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,980
because data quality checks are not being performed,

461
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,470
they know that they can get by,

462
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,823
by just making up data.

463
00:19:47,459 --> 00:19:50,343
They get it in on time by just making up some data.

464
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,550
This happens, this is a fact of life in many countries,

465
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,340
and it needs to be appreciated

466
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,820
and we need to have the controls to put it in.

467
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:03,730
So data quality issues are not a failure of the system,

468
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:06,960
they&#39;re a fact of any information system, really.

469
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,170
And what is the failure?

470
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:12,090
Is to not being able to address the data quality issues,

471
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:14,780
and specifically address them as they come in.

472
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,220
So I just wanna make the point is,

473
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,570
you know, no one here should be beating themselves up

474
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:19,520
that they have outliers,

475
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,420
or that they have data quality errors.

476
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,160
What they should be upset about

477
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,700
or what you should be upset about

478
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,980
is are you able to identify and address them?

479
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,163
And if you&#39;re not, that&#39;s a failure,

480
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:35,863
not the fact that they exist in the first place.

481
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:43,983
When we talk about data quality and data quality checks,

482
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,870
we like to think that it&#39;s some kind of race.

483
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:51,350
And here, I&#39;m kind of going back to an old analogy here

484
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,040
where the data quality issues

485
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,480
are like the rabbit or the hare,

486
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,500
and the data quality corrections are like the tortoise.

487
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,330
Usually in most country databases,

488
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:04,010
we see that data quality issues are coming in so fast,

489
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,843
they&#39;re constant,

490
00:21:04,843 --> 00:21:07,820
everyday more and more data quality issues coming in.

491
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,560
And we&#39;re not able to keep up with them.

492
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,730
Our data quality correction processes,

493
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,200
if we have them even,

494
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,700
are very slow, they&#39;re very formal,

495
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,710
they&#39;re too cumbersome,

496
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,820
we can&#39;t keep up with the volume

497
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,360
of data quality issues coming in.

498
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,290
And what does that mean?

499
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:24,120
That means that we have low data trust,

500
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,102
we have low data ownership,

501
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:29,350
and ultimately we have low data use.

502
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:31,630
Remember it all goes back to data use.

503
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,960
And what we need to appreciate is

504
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:38,010
that we have to build a process where these move together.

505
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,280
So our data quality issues

506
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,400
are moving at the exact same speed,

507
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,653
like the rabbit on the tortoise,

508
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,410
at the same time as our data quality corrections.

509
00:21:49,410 --> 00:21:51,490
We&#39;re talking about routine data quality corrections,

510
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,490
we&#39;re talking about standard operating procedures

511
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:54,500
that are built in,

512
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,130
that are integral to our entire operations

513
00:21:57,130 --> 00:21:58,870
within our information system

514
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,990
that account for data quality.

515
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,630
Everything is moving together,

516
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:04,092
everybody knows their job

517
00:22:04,092 --> 00:22:05,750
and we&#39;re utilizing all the tools

518
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,350
that we have available to us to stay on top of this.

519
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,420
Let&#39;s talk about some strategies to address

520
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,180
some data quality issues.

521
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,580
This is really what this whole academy is about,

522
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,458
is how do we actually start to get that hare

523
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:23,700
riding on that tortoise?

524
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,010
How do we actually get the data quality

525
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:27,290
correction processes moving at the same time

526
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:30,053
as our data quality issues as they come in?

527
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,500
A couple of points here,

528
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,340
the first one is that even before we get

529
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:39,540
any information system launched or implemented,

530
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,560
we need to appreciate how data quality affects design.

531
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,730
And again, we have an asynchronous session on this.

532
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:48,250
So we have an entire session on how to link up design

533
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,530
and data quality.

534
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:51,130
We need to make sure that the we have

535
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,970
the right training processes

536
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,730
and approaches to make sure that people understand

537
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,930
and are able to address data quality issues.

538
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,230
We need to make sure that everything is relevant,

539
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,100
that we&#39;ve taken into account

540
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,500
the various contexts

541
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,770
that the data quality checks will be performed.

542
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,770
For example, we can&#39;t, you know, potentially configure DHIS2

543
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,500
to send automated emails

544
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,860
whenever a data quality check is detected.

545
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,660
Well, is an automated email

546
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,663
relevant to a community health worker?

547
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,360
Most community health workers probably don&#39;t have emails,

548
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,130
at least in many countries throughout,

549
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,770
you know, Central and Southern Africa.

550
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:34,150
And maybe it&#39;s not appropriate

551
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,530
to start sending up email alerts

552
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,790
to community health workers,

553
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,290
maybe it&#39;s not relevant to them.

554
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,680
We have to find other ways,

555
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,120
other tools to be able to make sure

556
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,920
that they know about their data quality issues,

557
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,420
and they&#39;re able to address them.

558
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:47,610
And then finally have to give it sufficient resources.

559
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,340
If we&#39;re gonna take data quality seriously,

560
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,500
you have to give it the resources that it requires,

561
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:56,500
which is tools, staff, exercises, processes, routines,

562
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,270
meetings, workshops, trainings,

563
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,490
all of the things that you actually need

564
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:04,220
to actually get these kinds of things brought to life

565
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,513
requires resources.

566
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:11,020
When you actually have your system live and operating,

567
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,893
during data entry,

568
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,740
and kind of just in the routine processes,

569
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,490
you have to give yourself adequate time

570
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,990
to perform data quality checks.

571
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,250
It does take time,

572
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:24,393
it takes effort to be on top of the data quality.

573
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,500
You have to build data quality into your feedback,

574
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,220
and into your standard operating procedures.

575
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,110
Again, people need to see the data quality issues,

576
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,410
people need to be held accountable for their data.

577
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:41,410
That requires very intentional, very targeted feedback.

578
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,320
If you don&#39;t have feedback mechanisms

579
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,290
going down to district level to the facility level,

580
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,640
to community level,

581
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,790
there&#39;s a good chance that the data is not...

582
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:52,870
You have very low data accountability,

583
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,560
low ownership and poor data quality.

584
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,790
So the feedback has to be very intentional,

585
00:24:57,790 --> 00:25:00,360
and you need too, to figure out how to develop this feedback

586
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,400
and what&#39;s appropriate to the person

587
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,573
that you&#39;re giving that feedback to, right?

588
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,380
Data quality checks need to be routine,

589
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,020
they need to have very much...

590
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,690
They need to have intention behind them.

591
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,660
They can&#39;t just be,

592
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,970
oh, when you have time check the data quality.

593
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:18,540
No, they need to be built into people&#39;s process,

594
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,581
into their day-to-day work.

595
00:25:20,581 --> 00:25:24,900
And when possible, let&#39;s avoid manual aggregation.

596
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:28,020
Manual aggregation, as we saw in that reporting form

597
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,880
is a really easy place

598
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:33,810
to introduce a lot of data quality of issues.

599
00:25:33,810 --> 00:25:35,360
We need less manual aggregation,

600
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,560
let DHIS2 do the aggregation for you,

601
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,810
capture the most granular data

602
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,230
that you feel comfortable with,

603
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:43,030
and then let it aggregate that throughout the hierarchy.

604
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:47,510
After you have your data quality...

605
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,050
I mean, after you have your data in the system,

606
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,670
we need to have very specific events,

607
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:57,070
activities built around data quality assessments

608
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,650
and data cleaning.

609
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,010
Nora is gonna go through some of these

610
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,210
and we&#39;ll have an example from,

611
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,580
I think one of the case studies presented,

612
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,313
on how do you actually build procedures,

613
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,420
activities around routine

614
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,730
or maybe periodic data quality assessments

615
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,300
and data quality checks.

616
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,650
Extremely useful exercises,

617
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:21,410
WHO has a lot of really good guidance on this.

618
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,780
But once you have the data in the system,

619
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,070
the work is not done,

620
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:28,573
you have to routinely review it and clean it.

621
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:34,293
All right, so let&#39;s take a look at a quick cycle here.

622
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,860
All right, so data quality,

623
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:40,730
I talked about this virtuous cycle

624
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,153
where data quality and data use are connected,

625
00:26:45,082 --> 00:26:47,120
earlier in the presentation on my first or second slide.

626
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,740
Now I&#39;m gonna talk about what we call a vicious cycle

627
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,740
of poor data quality.

628
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,660
So we have poor data quality issues,

629
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,350
it results in data not being trusted,

630
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:59,983
this means that we have a weak demand for data.

631
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,890
A weak demand for data means that people

632
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,180
are not actually utilizing or valuing the HMIS,

633
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:10,030
they&#39;re not actually thinking that the information system

634
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,300
has any usefulness, has any utility,

635
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,363
if the data inside of it is just garbage.

636
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:20,020
That usually means that if people aren&#39;t appreciating

637
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:23,020
why the HMIS or information system is necessary,

638
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:27,630
that we end up having weak health information systems.

639
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,880
It&#39;s not updated, there&#39;s no one monitoring it,

640
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,963
no one is providing the admin support that it requires,

641
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,210
low data use, no one is really referring to it

642
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,120
when they&#39;re making decisions.

643
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,970
And that then feeds back into poor data quality.

644
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,350
This is a vicious cycle,

645
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,650
and it&#39;s something that you can spiral down

646
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:47,510
and you have to build in very specific activities,

647
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:49,720
exercises to enter our procedures, tools,

648
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,430
everything that we&#39;re gonna present to you in this academy,

649
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,730
to be able to break out of this vicious cycle.

650
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:00,800
One of the big outputs of this process breaking down,

651
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,210
and this is the arrow that&#39;s coming off

652
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,810
to the left of the screen here,

653
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,960
is that when the donors feel that they have lost

654
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,020
trust in the health information system,

655
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,950
what do they do?

656
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:12,050
They build their parallel systems

657
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,650
or programs or projects build parallel systems.

658
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:16,310
And then you end up in a situation

659
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:19,910
with many different information systems in one country,

660
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,240
some of which are reporting on the same thing,

661
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,903
a lot of redundant and parallel efforts,

662
00:28:26,731 --> 00:28:30,023
and they can all go down this trap together or individually,

663
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:33,100
but it does weaken the infrastructure

664
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,140
or the idea of a health information system,

665
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,530
a national health information system,

666
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,670
where all data&#39;s in one place.

667
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,290
Yeah, exactly, so fragmentation,

668
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:45,290
which leads us back to weak health information systems.

669
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,550
So you can see that data quality

670
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:51,220
is not just like affects kind of perceptions

671
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,840
and feelings about, you know, how data can be used,

672
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,760
it actually means that a lot of times

673
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,040
parallel systems are built,

674
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:04,040
fragmentation happens within the country or the project,

675
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:09,020
and that then just kind of exacerbates

676
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,453
or makes the whole situation even worse.

677
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,330
Right, so weak demand, weak decisions making.

678
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:19,100
All right, so from this presentation,

679
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,590
you have two assignments,

680
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:22,480
and this is important that you complete these assignments,

681
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,360
they are graded for completion,

682
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,870
not necessarily for accuracy,

683
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,650
because we&#39;re asking your opinion.

684
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:31,440
The first assignment is that we want you

685
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,320
to list five reasons why you have poor data quality

686
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,490
in your country or project.

687
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:38,460
What are those?

688
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:42,430
Some examples, wrong use of data,

689
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,420
some weird issues with indicator,

690
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,157
like I don&#39;t understand

691
00:29:46,157 --> 00:29:48,470
maternal mortality ratios at facilities.

692
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,450
You know, don&#39;t ask for ratios at facilities,

693
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,350
you know, you&#39;re asking for difficult data

694
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,493
at the lowest levels.

695
00:29:55,219 --> 00:29:56,550
Another example could be

696
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,940
lack of standard operating procedures,

697
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:00,500
or you have a large manual aggregation process,

698
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,680
little to no use or feedback.

699
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:06,320
Just what are some reasons

700
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,110
that you have poor data quality in your country?

701
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,340
It&#39;s important to appreciate what these are,

702
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,250
it&#39;s important to again, realize that everyone has poor data

703
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,913
at some point in their system.

704
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,023
It&#39;s not something to be embarrassed about,

705
00:30:19,023 --> 00:30:20,880
it&#39;s something to acknowledge

706
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,563
and to use as a motivation to improve.

707
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,510
So we are asking you to acknowledge

708
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,020
what are some of the issues that you have?

709
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,670
The second one is list five implications

710
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,820
of poor data quality in your country?

711
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,120
Having some poor data quality,

712
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,810
what does it actually mean?

713
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:42,100
What are the real-world consequences

714
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,650
of having poor data quality?

715
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,973
So wrong or no decisions are made,

716
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,240
lack of trust or use, weak accountability

717
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,290
and the vicious cycle.

718
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,910
So these are kind of broad ones.

719
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:55,010
But you can even be more specific than this.

720
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,470
You can say that we are not able

721
00:30:56,470 --> 00:30:58,770
to do our monthly planning meetings,

722
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,070
or we&#39;re not able to use data

723
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,240
in our monthly planning meetings

724
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,270
because of poor data quality.

725
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:06,450
Or maybe you have like fragmented system,

726
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,340
so like the malaria project

727
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,070
decided to build their own information system

728
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:13,180
&#39;cause they didn&#39;t trust the malaria data in the HMIS.

729
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:16,280
Or a donor came in and built their own immunization system

730
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,310
because they couldn&#39;t trust

731
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,410
the immunization data in the HMIS.

732
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,670
You can be very specific here,

733
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:22,400
and we would like to hear those stories

734
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,440
and understand what are some of the outcomes

735
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,290
or consequences of poor data quality.

736
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,770
Okay, so this is the last slide here,

737
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,150
again, hopefully you&#39;ve been asking

738
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:39,320
any questions that you have on the Slack channel.

739
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,640
If not, please go ahead and post those there.

740
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,603
We are now going to take a,

741
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,720
I guess it&#39;ll be a 12-minute break.

742
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,490
So we are gonna come back at,

743
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:54,430
on my time, 12:15, which is...

744
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,333
Oh, sorry, yeah, 12:15, which is 12 minutes from now,

745
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,590
so please take this time,

746
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,190
get yourself a new cup of coffee,

747
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:04,810
or a glass of tea, or a cup of tea,

748
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,720
take a bathroom break,

749
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,340
whatever&#39;s it is you need to do,

750
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,820
and we are gonna come back here,

751
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,543
in yeah, 12 minutes at 12:15.
