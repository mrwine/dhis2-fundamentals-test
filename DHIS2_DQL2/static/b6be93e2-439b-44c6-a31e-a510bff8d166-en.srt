00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,740
- [Instructor] So another item that I wanted to discuss,

1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,260
and we went over this

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,080
in our kind of overview of the session,

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,320
is about naming conventions.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,770
So we&#39;ll share the document

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,460
that we have on naming conventions,

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,450
but there&#39;s just a couple of key principles

7
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:16,400
that we can always keep in mind when we&#39;re naming things.

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,160
And the reason that this has an effect on system design

9
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,070
is our ability to find items

10
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,770
within our system accurately

11
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,270
and with minimal kind of effort.

12
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,770
So good naming practices that they help with identifying

13
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:29,810
these different data elements and indicators.

14
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:32,290
And there&#39;s some basic principles we can follow

15
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,198
for basically any data element or indicator that we create.

16
00:00:35,198 --> 00:00:39,360
So as a general rule, data elements do not need

17
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,610
the term number of in the name itself.

18
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:44,120
Now, maybe this is on the form.

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,540
Maybe this is somewhere else

20
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,770
when they&#39;re actually being displayed for entry purposes.

21
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,400
But when we&#39;re actually performing analysis,

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,570
this can make things a bit confusing.

23
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:56,060
As data elements will no longer be grouped in order,

24
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:57,420
there&#39;ll be grouped by number of,

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,740
and when you&#39;re looking for things in a list,

26
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,840
an order ordered list of some kind,

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,840
it makes it very difficult to find them.

28
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,270
We can talk about something similar for indicators.

29
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,100
So indicators should not be percentage of,

30
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:12,300
in the name itself.

31
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,000
Now maybe you can put a percentage symbol in brackets

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,240
at the end of the indicator name for example,

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,080
to clearly identify that you are having an indicator

34
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,600
that&#39;s the proportion of some kind,

35
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,330
and maybe just use the pound sign,

36
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,860
the number sign in brackets at the end of the name,

37
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,463
for example, for a numerator only indicator.

38
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:31,900
But you don&#39;t actually have to put the full

39
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,640
kind of text here because once again,

40
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,473
it makes sorting difficult.

41
00:01:35,473 --> 00:01:38,190
So these are some general principles for both data elements

42
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,780
and indicators that we can follow

43
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,720
when we&#39;re naming items in the system,

44
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,640
or even when maybe we have to go through

45
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,370
and rename numbers of items,

46
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:48,133
because how they&#39;ve been named previously is quite poor.

47
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,660
So here are a couple examples, a couple of concrete examples

48
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:56,650
of bad practices and kind of where we can get to

49
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,800
in terms of better practices or good practices.

50
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,030
So we can see in the bad practice item,

51
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,770
some names of the data elements and they&#39;re quite long.

52
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,460
And you know, this makes it difficult to read,

53
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:10,470
to sort, to really find what we need,

54
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,430
but we can take this and pair this down,

55
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:14,920
slowly but surely going through this process

56
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,780
of kind of getting to our good example

57
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,070
on the right side here,

58
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,450
where we&#39;re just having minimal texts

59
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,880
that accurately conveys

60
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,200
what that data element is representing.

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,740
You can also see that because of the way it is worded,

62
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,630
that things are kind of grouped together

63
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,670
just by their nature,

64
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,200
due to the alphabetical order of that list.

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,223
And that it makes it easier to find in a sense.

66
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,370
So this is something to consider, this is a manual process.

67
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,660
Again, we&#39;ve been talking about manual processes

68
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,580
a little bit, you know, this is not something

69
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,380
that can be automated necessarily.

70
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,640
You&#39;re going to have to go through the data elements

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,430
and identify which ones are kind of not working,

72
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,200
in terms of their naming convention.

73
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,120
And if you&#39;re adding new data elements,

74
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,670
that is something that you can take

75
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,510
a more proactive role in perhaps,

76
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,090
by having some kind of guidelines

77
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,843
on general naming standards for items in your system.

78
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,800
Here&#39;s a couple of examples for indicators as well.

79
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,680
And this is where we see the same kind of problems

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,200
that I mentioned earlier, right?

81
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,410
We have this percentage of, at the beginning

82
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,770
of the indicator name in a lot of cases,

83
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,460
and we see this in live systems all the time,

84
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:24,510
but this makes the listing of the indicators

85
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,190
in an ordered list quite difficult

86
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,370
because they&#39;re not grouped by anything significant.

87
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,910
The names are much longer than they should be.

88
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:33,460
So if you&#39;re creating a chart, for example,

89
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:36,569
with many data items on it, it&#39;s going to be, you know,

90
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:37,402
the names will be collapsed naturally

91
00:03:37,402 --> 00:03:39,890
because it just won&#39;t fit on the chart itself.

92
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,360
So there&#39;s a lot of implications here

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,720
in terms of analyzing our data

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,850
and outputting that data and just finding what we need.

95
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,880
So if we follow a couple of these very simple principles,

96
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:51,630
we can really make things easier to find in our system.

97
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:54,420
And this is once again, largely a manual process

98
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,770
and not something that can be easily automated.
