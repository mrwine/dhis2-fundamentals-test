0
00:00:00,146 --> 00:00:03,000
And I am going to now give a quick introductory PowerPoint

1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,240
just to walk us through

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:06,400
what we&#39;re actually gonna be doing this week.

3
00:00:07,284 --> 00:00:09,827
What are the objectives of this academy?

4
00:00:10,047 --> 00:00:12,267
Well, we really only have five main objectives.

5
00:00:12,267 --> 00:00:13,367
These are quite broad.

6
00:00:14,259 --> 00:00:16,728
But let&#39;s just go through these quickly.

7
00:00:16,728 --> 00:00:19,628
We want you to be able to understand

8
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:22,053
all of the necessary components of data quality.

9
00:00:22,053 --> 00:00:23,273
Many of you are experts.

10
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:25,343
Many of you could probably give

11
00:00:25,343 --> 00:00:29,053
a lot of these presentations and lectures yourself.

12
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:31,593
We appreciate all the various skillsets that are coming in,

13
00:00:31,593 --> 00:00:33,023
and we hope that you&#39;re able to communicate

14
00:00:33,264 --> 00:00:35,174
and talk to each other throughout this week

15
00:00:35,174 --> 00:00:37,414
to be able to share your own insights.

16
00:00:37,414 --> 00:00:40,774
But there are some foundational components of data quality

17
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,534
that everyone needs to appreciate.

18
00:00:42,534 --> 00:00:44,504
And if we collectively understand this,

19
00:00:44,504 --> 00:00:46,724
we can have conversations and build each other up around it.

20
00:00:46,724 --> 00:00:48,152
So that&#39;s a big part of today

21
00:00:48,152 --> 00:00:51,235
is understanding these necessary components of data quality.

22
00:00:52,048 --> 00:00:54,278
This exists outside of DHIS2.

23
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:58,507
This is everyday work, data quality kind of concepts.

24
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,762
The next objective is that we want you to be able

25
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:06,431
to know how to use all of the key DHIS2 functionalities

26
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:07,851
for data quality.

27
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:10,181
Our promise that there are many functionalities

28
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:11,561
that you&#39;re probably not using.

29
00:01:11,561 --> 00:01:14,921
There&#39;s a lot of incredible features in DHIS2

30
00:01:14,921 --> 00:01:17,811
that allow you to perform routine,

31
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:21,664
annual or even notifications and alerts,

32
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,697
automatic data quality checks.

33
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:27,777
It&#39;s important that you know how to use all of these,

34
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:30,227
know when to use them, know how to use them,

35
00:01:30,227 --> 00:01:32,607
and then you&#39;re able to apply them to your own projects

36
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:36,477
and or country implementations.

37
00:01:36,477 --> 00:01:38,097
And I think that&#39;s the third bullet point,

38
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,647
is we really want you to be able to take away

39
00:01:39,647 --> 00:01:41,447
from this academy practical skills

40
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:43,577
that you can immediately apply.

41
00:01:43,577 --> 00:01:46,917
We don&#39;t want this to just be apps, just theoretical.

42
00:01:46,917 --> 00:01:48,807
We want you to actually be able to say,

43
00:01:48,807 --> 00:01:50,357
hey, I can use that feature.

44
00:01:50,357 --> 00:01:53,127
I can use that tool that Scott or Bob

45
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:55,407
or whoever just introduced to me,

46
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:58,937
and I&#39;m gonna be able to immediately use this

47
00:01:58,937 --> 00:02:03,915
and start performing routine data quality checks next week,

48
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,064
later this week.&quot;

49
00:02:05,064 --> 00:02:07,034
We want these things to be immediately implemented.

50
00:02:07,034 --> 00:02:08,074
And we wanna hear about it.

51
00:02:08,074 --> 00:02:11,224
We want to hear about the successes, the failures,

52
00:02:11,224 --> 00:02:14,874
your user stories that you have in using DHIS2

53
00:02:14,874 --> 00:02:16,554
for data quality checks.

54
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:19,404
But we&#39;re gonna incorporate all of this feedback,

55
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:21,134
as well as answer any of your questions

56
00:02:21,134 --> 00:02:23,874
into some guidance documentations

57
00:02:23,874 --> 00:02:25,974
and to improve this academy going forward.

58
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,284
The second to last bullet point here

59
00:02:29,284 --> 00:02:31,234
is we wanna make sure that you are exposed

60
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,264
to a variety of use cases and examples.

61
00:02:33,457 --> 00:02:36,667
There are many really wonderful examples

62
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:39,994
and stories that exist out there of people using DHIS2

63
00:02:39,994 --> 00:02:43,117
for data quality checks,

64
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:47,097
and really utilizing the features to the max.

65
00:02:47,097 --> 00:02:48,897
And that&#39;s what we wanna expose you to.

66
00:02:48,897 --> 00:02:51,057
So it&#39;s one thing for me to kind of go through everything

67
00:02:51,057 --> 00:02:53,527
in theory, it&#39;s a very different,

68
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:57,727
an extremely useful thing for you to be able to see people

69
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:58,637
actually doing it.

70
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,527
And so throughout the week,

71
00:03:00,527 --> 00:03:01,527
you&#39;re going to be seeing

72
00:03:01,527 --> 00:03:07,154
all of the several different data quality user stories,

73
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:09,664
and you can start to build up

74
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:11,564
your own data quality strategies and plans

75
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:13,065
around what other people have done.

76
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,820
There&#39;s a whole world of DHIS2 users out there,

77
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,490
many, many countries doing different things.

78
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,700
You don&#39;t have to reinvent the wheel.

79
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,200
You can just build on top of what good practices

80
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,750
other people have already done.

81
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,189
The final point, and this is the one

82
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:28,849
that I really wanna kind of drive home as much as possible

83
00:03:28,849 --> 00:03:30,719
is we wanna build a DHIS2 community

84
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,519
of practice around data quality.

85
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,579
Everyone is talking about data use, data use, data use.

86
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:39,142
Lots of folks focus on individual disease programs,

87
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:42,493
patient tracking.

88
00:03:42,493 --> 00:03:44,581
But there doesn&#39;t really exist

89
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:47,861
a strong DHIS2 community of practice

90
00:03:47,861 --> 00:03:50,041
that&#39;s principally concerned with data quality.

91
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:52,681
And of course, we appreciate that without data quality,

92
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,131
people aren&#39;t gonna use data.

93
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:56,078
All of the data that&#39;s coming in

94
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:58,968
from these various disease programs and projects,

95
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:01,064
it&#39;s not gonna be useful, it&#39;s not gonna be reliable.

96
00:04:01,064 --> 00:04:04,020
And so just as much as we focus on all the other aspects

97
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,740
of the different types of data we get in,

98
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,770
the different way to look at data and visualize data,

99
00:04:09,348 --> 00:04:11,368
it&#39;s equally as important, if not more so,

100
00:04:11,561 --> 00:04:13,894
to also have a group focused on data quality

101
00:04:13,894 --> 00:04:35,124
and how do we address data quality in DHIS2?
