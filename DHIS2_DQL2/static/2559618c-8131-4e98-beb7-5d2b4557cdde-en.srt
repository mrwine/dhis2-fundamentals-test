00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,043
- [Instructor] Okay.

1
00:00:01,043 --> 00:00:05,180
Another item to discuss is the data integrity checks,

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:06,970
and it&#39;s called data integrity checks,

3
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:09,910
but it&#39;s actually more of a metadata integrity check.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:13,398
It&#39;s not really checking the integrity of the data itself,

5
00:00:13,398 --> 00:00:17,280
but, because it kind of looks at the metadata,

6
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,680
there is some link then to, you know,

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,263
how this reflects upon the data quality itself.

8
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:29,440
So this is a function in DHIS2, that&#39;s built right in,

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,670
that you can run in order to kind of see the results of.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,980
So, resolving these integrity violations

11
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,520
is quite an important aspect of both data quality

12
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,050
and data usability.

13
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,136
If a lot of their, a lot of these violations,

14
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:48,069
when they&#39;re resolved, really help people kind of select

15
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:52,100
the right, the certain, the right items when they&#39;re

16
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,310
creating their analysis.

17
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,010
And then obviously, if you&#39;re reviewing these items

18
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:58,670
routinely, it also allows you to kind of assess

19
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,690
the data quality more appropriately.

20
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:05,100
But, in practice, this is often a very low priority

21
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,970
resolving these issues.

22
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,500
This becomes quite challenging if you want the data quality

23
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,220
of your system to be improved.

24
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:13,640
As well as just kind of, you know,

25
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,543
improve the amount of data that is being used routinely.

26
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,990
The reasoning behind this, this link to data quality,

27
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,660
is because these data integrity check violations,

28
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:29,283
they tend to result in incorrect data itself.

29
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,160
So, there&#39;s kind of a direct, I will say correlation,

30
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,330
between the two and it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean

31
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:38,950
it&#39;s causing this problem,

32
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:43,950
but often it can be directly affecting at least what we see

33
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,050
in terms of our outputs.

34
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:51,050
And because it&#39;s causing problems with incorrect outputs,

35
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,600
then you know, the data quality itself might be reflected

36
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,395
on this because we&#39;re not really sure what kind of

37
00:01:56,395 --> 00:01:58,230
assumptions to make.

38
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:01,600
We might think that we need to clean certain pieces of data,

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,350
but we&#39;re not really sure because we&#39;re not really sure what

40
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,560
that metadata should be pointing to.

41
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,570
And that&#39;s where the kind of problem lies, right?

42
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:11,050
The linkage between that metadata

43
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,600
and the data that we&#39;re seeing.

44
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,900
So, data integrity checks, or metadata integrity checks,

45
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,380
as I like to call them, they run a series of queries

46
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,700
that look at various aspects of the database.

47
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,370
And this is true for both aggregate datasets

48
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,490
and tracker programs.

49
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,120
So as an example, they could look at things like, you know,

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
all organization units should belong

51
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,560
to an organization unit group, right?

52
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,798
So when you add up all your organization unit groups

53
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:43,740
within a group set in particular, you know,

54
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,180
you should be getting the total number

55
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,890
of organization units at that particular level

56
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,690
that you&#39;re creating that group for.

57
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,530
You should also, you know, it also looks at things

58
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:56,200
like indicators with identical formulas.

59
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,490
So, you know, if there&#39;s several indicators

60
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,740
that have the same exact data elements in their formula,

61
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,820
you know, why do those duplicates exist?

62
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,280
So a total of 32 checks are run and we can access

63
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,280
this via data administration.

64
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,723
So let&#39;s have a quick look at this in practice.

65
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,210
So, if we navigate to data administration within DHIS2,

66
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,540
we can run data integrity,

67
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:24,230
even though it&#39;s metadata integrity, really,

68
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:27,790
but we can run this integrity check by clicking on this

69
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:30,453
first box here, checking data integrity.

70
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,510
And we just click on the item, run integrity checks.

71
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,550
So, this actually takes a little bit of time

72
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,950
because it&#39;s assessing your whole system essentially.

73
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,590
So, I&#39;m just going to come back when this is complete,

74
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,410
essentially, so you don&#39;t have to stare

75
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,280
at the screen loading.

76
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,960
Okay. So the data integrity check has completed running,

77
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,530
and I&#39;m just going to scroll through.

78
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:56,690
Any of these red violations are sorry, any of this in red

79
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,850
text are indicating violations.

80
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:01,260
And then when they&#39;re in green, it&#39;s saying, you know,

81
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,020
there&#39;s a check box next to it because it&#39;s passed

82
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,190
the integrity check, essentially.

83
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,910
So, any of these green items, I can&#39;t click on them

84
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:10,980
and expand and actually see because the database

85
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,910
has met the criteria essentially.

86
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,440
And we see that there&#39;s a mix of aggregate and tracker

87
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,300
being included here. You know, so things like program rules

88
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,300
and are also being checked during this process.

89
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,310
So if I go up here and I&#39;ll just click on one of these

90
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,223
data elements without a dataset.

91
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:34,128
Right? So I expand this and it actually gives me the list

92
00:04:34,128 --> 00:04:38,240
of data elements that don&#39;t have a data set.

93
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,420
And, you know, what is the purpose of these data elements?

94
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,713
Did they exist in a data set before?

95
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,660
You know, so the whole idea is to identify these

96
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:49,000
and then work through them individually

97
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,923
and see how we can fix them.

98
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,630
So we can look at a couple other ones.

99
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:57,020
Indicators without groups. You know, same thing.

100
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:01,820
So all of this is kind of a mix of usability

101
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,880
and also kind of effecting our data quality.

102
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,593
Indicators with identical formulas, you know?

103
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,070
So, why are these things kind of there?

104
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,400
You know, it doesn&#39;t really make a lot of sense

105
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,284
when these things are violated.

106
00:05:15,284 --> 00:05:18,342
And there can be some implications that result directly

107
00:05:18,342 --> 00:05:20,790
in issues with our data.

108
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:23,260
So we have to be kind of careful when we see this.

109
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,360
Now, once again, as I mentioned, the priority to fix

110
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,130
these is often low,

111
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,264
but if we have a look at all the things it assesses,

112
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,730
we should really consider fixing some of these things

113
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:37,429
because it can have a direct impact on how we&#39;re kind of,

114
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:40,190
you know, seeing our information

115
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,543
and also what effect this has on the outputs that we create.

116
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:47,710
So, what I would recommend is that you actually

117
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,030
log in to one of the demo systems we have.

118
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,360
I put the link here for you and just run the data

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:57,380
integrity check, the metadata integrity check.

120
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,880
See, as you can see, it&#39;s not checking any data.

121
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,490
This is running purely checks against the metadata.

122
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:06,234
And just think about how you would potentially fix

123
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:09,370
some of these problems. You know, some of them have

124
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,450
immediate solutions when you look at them,

125
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:13,600
others might not be so clear.

126
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,980
So, just click on the database link below,

127
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,120
use the login that you created for that particular database.

128
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,210
It&#39;s the same as the data quality app

129
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,910
configuration exercise,

130
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:26,000
and just run the data integrity check

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,573
and see what you come up with.
