00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,300
- [Andrew] Thank you for allowing me

1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:05,757
to present in this academy.

2
00:00:07,152 --> 00:00:08,720
It&#39;s a unique opportunity

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:11,530
to share our experience on the ground

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:14,510
and my presentation will focus much more

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:19,510
on the approach that Rwanda used to strengthen the HMIS

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,750
through DHIS2 and improve the data quality.

7
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:27,360
So like other countries, many other countries,

8
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,990
we went through the challenge of having the system

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:33,190
that was really responding to the needs

10
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:36,250
of the Ministry of Health.

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,250
And the system by that time in before 2000,

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:43,580
the system was not a web-based system

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,360
and I remember by that time their reporting rate was 60%.

14
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,360
So imagine taking a decision on the 60% completeness

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,610
so you can obviously see

16
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,980
that the data is not representative.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,760
So that&#39;s when we started looking at a web-based system

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,000
that could be able to improve the reporting processes

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,910
but also improve the completeness.

20
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:15,200
So in 2011,

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,000
we started the process of reviewing our reporting form

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,160
because we could have not managed to move to the web-based

23
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,160
when we still have tools that were not harmonized.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,100
And secondly, we wanted to have

25
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,650
one integrated reporting form

26
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:35,820
and bringing up also the development of SOP

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,270
to standardize the data collection

28
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,960
to ensure that the methods and interpretation of indicators

29
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,540
across the facilities is the same.

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,610
And also reducing the workload to the health facilities.

31
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,800
So those were the major criteria

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,210
that we used to review the reporting form.

33
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,370
So in 2012, we launched the web-based system,

34
00:01:55,370 --> 00:02:00,110
which was built on top of DHIS2 platform, DHIS2,

35
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,880
and later in 2013, we developed different tools

36
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,260
like Indicator Reference Manual and others.

37
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,530
But as soon as we started in 2011,

38
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,840
we started with the standard operating procedures

39
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,040
for data management and for data quality assurance.

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,040
So in 2014, we kept on integrating other system

41
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,650
like a case-based system like e-TB and others

42
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:26,380
built on top of Tracker.

43
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,360
Then 2018, we kept on strengthening the system

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,653
by integrating the WHO data quality apps and other packages.

45
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:41,430
Then what we did was coming up with these tools

46
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,180
before we even engage

47
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,130
or bring the web-based system in place,

48
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,200
which is the IT solution.

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,180
So we developed the standard operating procedures

50
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:54,840
for districts and health facilities

51
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:57,540
that governs the data management

52
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:01,530
and reporting data verification and validations.

53
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:03,730
And we also reviewed the data collection tools

54
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,090
like patient files, registers and reporting forms.

55
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,630
Then later, as I said,

56
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,990
we also devoted the Indicator Reference Manual

57
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,600
to ensure that everything is harmonized

58
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,410
in terms of indicator definitions and interpretations

59
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,460
and common errors in interpreting some of the indicators.

60
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,600
So that was not only what we did,

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,680
it was also to bring in some accountability kind of,

62
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,821
but also sharing

63
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:29,220
the publication of Annual Statistical Booklet

64
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,993
and also promoting the information use.

65
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,890
So you may ask yourself

66
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,890
why was very important to have these tools standardized

67
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,610
and why SOP, developing these SOP?

68
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,800
One is that we had unclear roles and responsibility

69
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,450
at facility level.

70
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,140
I remember in 2011, we used to blame

71
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:58,240
some of the facility that they are not reporting.

72
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,680
Then they could ask you, &quot;Who was supposed to do it?&quot;

73
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,420
There was no clear roles and responsibility to know

74
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:06,390
who is doing what, at which level?

75
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,253
Then another one was we identified

76
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:12,520
that we have fragmentation of tools,

77
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,830
many tools that some of them were repetitive.

78
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:19,030
You can imagine that you&#39;re writing Andrew

79
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:23,360
in like thirty registers and you&#39;re repeating the same name.

80
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,380
So we said, no, it&#39;s better to harmonize the tools

81
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,930
and ensure that someone writes,

82
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:31,670
if it&#39;s a case, you just write it once or two times

83
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,270
but not many times.

84
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:36,610
And also systems, we had many systems that were fragmented,

85
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,910
vertical ones.

86
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,360
Then another gap that we had,

87
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,360
it was that there was no standard data collection processes.

88
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:48,200
So each facility used to just report the way they want

89
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,360
and this one was a gap.

90
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,070
Another one was unclear definitions and many more.

91
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,360
I will share these ones then you can be able to read.

92
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,900
So there was an urgent need to ensure that all of these

93
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,890
are harmonized and standardized,

94
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,950
and we have like a standard operating procedure

95
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,220
to show that everything is done in the same way

96
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,380
and the way we define our indicators

97
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,363
and collecting them is the same way.

98
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:14,270
So you can believe that when you are improving

99
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:18,220
or harmonizing your processes in terms of data quality,

100
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,650
this is what you do.

101
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,760
So you are trying to move people from this workload

102
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:27,240
that you can see that people are dragged into the data

103
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,120
and they spend much time just to collect data

104
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,030
and they spend much time to keep these papers.

105
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,310
So when we share that ensuring data quality,

106
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,190
what do we mean?

107
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,900
Is ensuring that we reduce all these workloads

108
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,540
to the health workers so that data collection is simplified

109
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:47,130
in a way that it doesn&#39;t take long time

110
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,280
for the health workers.

111
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,070
The SOP, what was the purpose of the SOP?

112
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,280
The purpose of the SOP like data management

113
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,640
is a standard operating procedure.

114
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,640
It was to really clarify or highlight across the facility

115
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,850
the procedure for data collection,

116
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:07,757
what do you do when you are collecting the data?

117
00:06:07,757 --> 00:06:10,220
And the procedure for data quality assurance,

118
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,410
what do you do to ensure that the data you&#39;re collecting

119
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,680
from the registers is the same as what you are reporting

120
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,320
in the electronic system?

121
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,980
So then it was also to clarify

122
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,683
the health related records, storage.

123
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:25,147
Most of the time they used to ask us,

124
00:06:25,147 --> 00:06:28,990
&quot;How long are we going to keep these facility registers?

125
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,780
All of these were supposed to be clarified

126
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,420
and also retention.&quot;

127
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,440
Another one was data reporting,

128
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,150
like putting in some timeline,

129
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:40,810
knowing that if you&#39;re reporting on a monthly basis,

130
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:43,890
when do we say that data is reported on time basis?

131
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:48,890
When we say that data is not reported on time basis?

132
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,770
So we had also the chapter on the data sharing and access

133
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,120
and then release,

134
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,560
but also we have the analysis and dissemination.

135
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,330
On analysis and dissemination,

136
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:03,890
we also added the key indicators that they have to analyze

137
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,900
and measure their performance at facility level.

138
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,310
So all above chapters,

139
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:12,700
they really highlight the general principles

140
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,920
when it comes to data management.

141
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,870
Then roles and responsibility,

142
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,280
it means that if you have someone

143
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,510
in charge of data management,

144
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,660
what is the role of the data manager?

145
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,360
What is the role of the chief nursing?

146
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,400
What is the role of the clinical director?

147
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,520
Everyone have to have a role.

148
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,730
What is the role of the head of the facility?

149
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,860
So when everything is really well-defined,

150
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:36,140
so from there you could be able to know

151
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,990
who didn&#39;t do what he was supposed to do

152
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,990
to ensure that data is reported on time.

153
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:45,520
So we also developed the data quality assessment, SOP,

154
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,030
which is standard operating procedure

155
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,480
that have four chapters

156
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,460
that really highlight the introduction.

157
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,270
why do we have this data quality assessment, SOP?

158
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,020
Then the overview of the data quality assessment process,

159
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,200
then the data quality assessment procedures

160
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,860
and data validation.

161
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,790
Then again, there&#39;s something that we always don&#39;t consider

162
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,850
when it comes to assessment, giving feedback,

163
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:13,460
which is the important part, and debriefing.

164
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:16,220
So this SOP really defines well

165
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,640
how you do the overall assessment,

166
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:22,150
and the way you give the feedback to the facility

167
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:25,430
to ensure that they also consider the improvement

168
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,140
on what you have identified as gaps.

169
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:33,140
Then the SOP, again, highlights the appendices

170
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,310
like a final report template.

171
00:08:35,309 --> 00:08:37,690
We don&#39;t want people to invent,

172
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,850
like example of notification letter,

173
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:43,190
like if you&#39;re going to visit a facility,

174
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,380
you don&#39;t have to write a letter, the letter is there,

175
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,650
you only put the demo facility.

176
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:48,990
Then the correction form

177
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,690
in case you want to do some correction

178
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,630
to ensure that we track the logs,

179
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,260
we have the correction form.

180
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:57,960
Then the routine data quality tool assessment, audit tool.

181
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,960
This was there before the WHO data quality app

182
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,993
but now we are shifting towards the WHO data quality app.

183
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,750
Again, the data quality app

184
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:09,270
also focuses on the general principle, as I said,

185
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,560
and it also defines the roles and responsibility

186
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,270
of each health staff

187
00:09:13,270 --> 00:09:17,313
to ensure that whoever is in the facility knows his role.

188
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:21,433
Then it details the procedures for each chapter.

189
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,340
Here is an example of what we have on the data quality

190
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:32,700
standard operating procedure or data management.

191
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,670
First of all, it defines the type of reports that we have

192
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:39,820
responsible person to ensure that that report is submitted.

193
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:44,783
Reporting level, is it central level? Is it district?

194
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,460
Then timeframe, is it immediate?

195
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,270
Like disease surveillance, is it monthly?

196
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:53,520
Is it daily? Is it weekly?

197
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,870
So everything is defined.

198
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:58,193
Then from there, you can see the table on my right,

199
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,720
that really defines the months

200
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,460
that defines what they have to do.

201
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,390
On 25th up to 30th,

202
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,090
they have to ensure that they gather all registers together

203
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,470
and ensure that no register is missing.

204
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,670
Then first 1st to 5th,

205
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:15,480
they have to report this into the system

206
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:20,183
and the system tracks the reported data up to fifth

207
00:10:20,183 --> 00:10:23,162
as that the timely reporting.

208
00:10:23,162 --> 00:10:24,800
Then 5th to 15th,

209
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,350
the system is opened for any data correction.

210
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:30,610
Then 15th, the system automatically blocks the dataset.

211
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,250
So it means after 15th,

212
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,940
they cannot report anything into the system.

213
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:37,710
So at least this one gives them the discipline

214
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:42,687
to ensure that on each provided timeframe,

215
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,570
they are really using it to maximize

216
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:50,020
the process that is done at that timeframe.

217
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,250
Then when they know that the dataset will not be opened

218
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,900
for data to be entered any time,

219
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:59,450
they also make this business to be serious.

220
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:03,210
So in SOPs and Indicator Reference Manual,

221
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,990
we tried to make it flexible

222
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,110
to ensure that it also tracks some common errors

223
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,060
that someone can encounter.

224
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,880
So we highlight them clearly on the reference manual

225
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,313
and SOP also.

226
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,750
As I said, we are also using the packages

227
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,230
to ensure that we simplify the way of data visualization

228
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:26,830
and the more you want people to use information

229
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:31,100
and improve the data,

230
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:34,403
you have to ensure that the tools they&#39;re using,

231
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:41,550
they are simple to use and they are able to visualize

232
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,990
the information that they want.

233
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,000
So these are different problems that we have modules

234
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,560
that we have in the system.

235
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,090
There is a program related to routine clinical reports,

236
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:57,060
case based data, which is e-TB, EPI tracker,

237
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,970
medical certification of causes of death.

238
00:11:58,970 --> 00:12:00,130
We have on annual reports.

239
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,680
We have daily flash reports from the hospital

240
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,950
that are used by the Ministry of Health

241
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,270
to track the process,

242
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:11,420
to track the daily update from the facility.

243
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,130
We have disease surveillance.

244
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:15,610
We have PBF, performance based financing.

245
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,683
We have a COVID module into the DHIS2.

246
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,280
Then regarding the mechanism.

247
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,950
I think many people they are really interested to see

248
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,360
what are the mechanism that we use

249
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,560
to ensure that the data is of good quality.

250
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,080
We have different mechanism

251
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:39,273
but I will highlight the major ones.

252
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,250
The normal ones that we&#39;re all familiar with

253
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,480
is the normal data quality checks,

254
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,610
where we have what we call ISS,

255
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:52,700
integrated supportive supervision,

256
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:56,950
that we jointly work with the development partners

257
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,897
and we take data from HMIS

258
00:12:58,897 --> 00:13:00,780
and we go down to the facilities

259
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,510
to check if what did they reported into HMIS

260
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:05,350
is exactly the same as what they have

261
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,930
in the source of data.

262
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:11,930
So this is a central level data checking, which is ISS,

263
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,700
integrated supportive supervision.

264
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,560
We have also the program specific data checking

265
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,830
where they bring the head of the hospitals together

266
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,280
because each hospital at least has 12 health centers.

267
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,420
So when they come together,

268
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,340
they give them feedback on the data,

269
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:33,360
then from there they are able to check their data.

270
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,440
So we have also validation rules in the system.

271
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,280
We also promote the information

272
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:41,630
using the analysis and feedback from the central level

273
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,240
which is the HMIS team.

274
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,380
Then we have this data set locking and approval.

275
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,980
Then we have the performance based financing,

276
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:51,690
which is also promotes the data quality.

277
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,460
So we also have the accreditations.

278
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,273
It means the performance based is that people,

279
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:05,459
we have like indicators on completeness and timeliness

280
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,190
and if three indicators when all of them they are 100%,

281
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:17,280
that&#39;s when they have the scoring of the PBF,

282
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,510
which is performance based financing.

283
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,870
Then accreditation is that most of them

284
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,110
they struggle to ensure that they get on a certain level

285
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,970
when it comes to accreditation.

286
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:32,300
Then we have decentralized also data review,

287
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:36,880
which is the monthly data validation done by the facilities.

288
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,750
So that one also is the additional part of that data review

289
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,773
and an improvement of the data quality.

290
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:49,230
So this is the example

291
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:54,190
of the monthly data validation meetings from the facilities.

292
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:57,640
You can see that they come together on a monthly basis

293
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:02,520
then they review the tools that they have

294
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:06,190
if whatever tallies they made

295
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,100
is exactly what is in the registers.

296
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,540
You can see that my people here

297
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,650
they&#39;re on the registers checking.

298
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,530
You can see the other ones are just there

299
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:15,620
they are presenting the data

300
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,150
that have been reported in the system

301
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:21,690
to ensure that they validate before the dataset is locked.

302
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,930
Then here they&#39;re also checking

303
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,420
if exactly what they reported

304
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,200
is the same as what they have in the source of data.

305
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,240
So on the data use part,

306
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,893
we also have the coordination meetings.

307
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,500
Coordination meetings is the monthly meetings

308
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,690
that the district hospitals,

309
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,010
because at each district hospital,

310
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:41,330
they have the catchment area.

311
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,180
So that catchment area comes together to review

312
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,410
what are the indicators

313
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,610
to check if they are really on track.

314
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:52,090
So at least these coordination meetings on monthly basis

315
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,180
also promotes the information use.

316
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:58,140
We have also the DHMT quarterly meetings that is done

317
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,360
bringing together the overall district

318
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,050
with each catchment area health facilities

319
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,780
and they have selected people to attend.

320
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,740
They also use it to present the health status

321
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,190
on their catchment area.

322
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:14,200
So all of this is towards to improve the information use

323
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,570
but also it also contributes to the data quality.

324
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:21,670
So not only that, we also have the central level,

325
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:26,470
we have senior management meeting that also uses the data.

326
00:16:27,369 --> 00:16:29,205
We also have development partners

327
00:16:29,205 --> 00:16:31,788
that also look at data quality.

328
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,340
All of that also contributes a lot

329
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,970
when it comes to quality data.

330
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,970
So we also use the global tools like many other countries,

331
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:49,220
because these tools have really brought a huge change

332
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,960
when it comes to data review and checking

333
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,690
like the WHO data quality tool,

334
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:58,400
is really a nice tool that we have institutionalized

335
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,410
in our standard operating procedures

336
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:03,560
and also trained our people to use it because it&#39;s a tool

337
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:06,110
that can be able to show you the outliers

338
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:09,120
and you can be able to show you the inconsistencies

339
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,120
along your data when you try to analyze it as a trend.

340
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,860
So this is the example of the WHO tool

341
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:22,000
and some of the charts that we generate.

342
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,590
So what we did is that we, thank you Scott and Bob.

343
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,420
We really worked with Scott and Bob

344
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,190
to ensure that our teams, I mean in Rwanda,

345
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,690
they are trained to know how to use it.

346
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,120
And it was a collaboration between University of Oslo,

347
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,710
WHO, and Ministry of Health.

348
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:45,710
So the tool for us to maximize its use, we reviewed in 2012,

349
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,520
we reviewed our standard operating procedures

350
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,710
to accommodate some of the features of the tool

351
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,370
and to ensure that it&#39;s also part of our everyday life

352
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:58,310
in the health facilities.

353
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,190
So not only that, we&#39;ve been working with the team,

354
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:07,190
I mean, Scott and Bob, and Ministry of Health team

355
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:09,380
to ensure that we have the dashboards

356
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:14,080
that are able to allow people to monitor their completeness

357
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,590
at facility level,

358
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,980
to monitor the trend of the data over time,

359
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,920
and also this one is a way of simplifying

360
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:24,343
the visualization of data on their fingertips.

361
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:32,140
Not only that, but also whenever I present this,

362
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,650
people always ask me about sustainability

363
00:18:36,650 --> 00:18:40,770
to ensure that whoever we train is in place

364
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:45,617
and nothing is compromised and we have continuity.

365
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:53,950
I think as part of that&#39;s why I like these academies,

366
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:58,230
the academy approach is really a good framework

367
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,397
to ensure that countries have the sustainability

368
00:19:01,397 --> 00:19:05,310
and also have the continuity of these good interventions.

369
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:11,750
Like in Rwanda we&#39;ve been really hosting different academies

370
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,630
before COVID, even we&#39;ve been attending different academies.

371
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:20,040
So what we did was like having our people

372
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,940
attending these kind of academies,

373
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,190
like data quality academy,

374
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:27,130
then we use to maximize it,

375
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:29,430
like ensuring that at least at each program,

376
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:31,700
we have a maximum number of people

377
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,860
that are able to customize the DHIS2,

378
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,130
that are able to configure the data quality,

379
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,560
that are able to support their facilities.

380
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,240
This one was also a motivation

381
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,760
because even if one person leaves the ministry

382
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,940
or the facility,

383
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,540
at least we are able to have someone

384
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,040
that can be able to train the rest

385
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,630
or can be able to replace other team.

386
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:55,590
So I could encourage countries

387
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,550
to attend these kind of academies to gain skills

388
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:00,840
because the more you attend the academies,

389
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,260
the more you gain skills of new features

390
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:06,260
and the more you get some insights from the country stories.

391
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,690
Not only that, as we&#39;ve been really implementing

392
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:14,160
these good initiatives,

393
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,760
but we were also having some constraint

394
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,600
when it comes to trainings.

395
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,910
And the problem was that we used to train

396
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:24,200
because we have money of training

397
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,940
but we are looking forward to see how could we train

398
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,540
based on the needs from the ground

399
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,560
not based on the funding available.

400
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,760
So we&#39;ve thought about the e-learning

401
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,000
and we said let&#39;s come up with a way,

402
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,950
a remote way to train people

403
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,980
because the more we have new features,

404
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,397
the more we&#39;ll need to train people.

405
00:20:41,397 --> 00:20:43,340
The more we see that you have gaps,

406
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,730
the more we need to train them.

407
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:49,730
So we came up with e-learning that is now online.

408
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,560
We previously we managed to train all health centers

409
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:57,310
and district hospitals and district administration staff

410
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:59,290
on the data quality processes

411
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:02,380
and it was much more to ensure that the data quality app

412
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,980
is well used.

413
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,077
Then our slogan is that,

414
00:21:07,077 --> 00:21:09,270
&quot;It&#39;s time to move learning to people

415
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:12,890
instead of moving people to learning.&quot;

416
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,890
So you may ask what is the contribution of the quality data,

417
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,504
or having the web-based system in place,

418
00:21:23,504 --> 00:21:26,747
or not only having the web-based system

419
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,880
but also using the DHIS2

420
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,640
because the more you have it updated,

421
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,470
you gain from many features

422
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:39,470
that can really improve your data quality

423
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:43,260
but again also raise the confidence of policy makers

424
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,730
to use your data.

425
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,100
So most of the contribution

426
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:49,270
is on the policy and strategic decisions

427
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,270
because we are lucky that we have one integrated

428
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,940
case management information system that collects all data.

429
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,710
So it makes it to be used and trustable

430
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,940
and used in planning, program planning and management,

431
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:07,150
resource management, capacity building,

432
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,180
disease surveillance,

433
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,530
because even disease surveillance we&#39;re using DHIS2,

434
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,023
innovations, and research and M&amp;E.

435
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:20,250
So even though I presented some interventions

436
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,650
around data quality but we still have a long way to go

437
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:26,370
because we are not where we want to be.

438
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,950
We are still promoting the information used

439
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,520
because it&#39;s not at that level that we want

440
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,330
and because now we are focusing at facility

441
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:37,250
because at the central level is good

442
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:40,120
but it&#39;s much better if we keep pushing people

443
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,430
at facility and district level to use data

444
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:44,650
instead of us telling them

445
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:46,430
that maybe malaria have increased,

446
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:48,950
we are promoting now another approach

447
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,000
of having the information from them, bottom up.

448
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,180
So again, we are really now installing different features,

449
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:03,850
WHO features to ensure that we really maximize

450
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,700
the use of these packages

451
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,315
because most of them they are developed

452
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:11,860
based on the standards, on the global standards

453
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,860
and because Rwanda is also part of the global standards,

454
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:22,930
so we are taking advantage of these global standards

455
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:27,840
because most of them they have some experts

456
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,230
that have been really concentrating

457
00:23:29,230 --> 00:23:31,330
to ensure that they bring together information

458
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,950
that may really help

459
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:35,590
and you countries may take advantage of.

460
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,540
What I like is that these packages are free

461
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:41,540
and that makes us really play with them

462
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,970
and use them to really improve what we are doing

463
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:45,530
in the countries.

464
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:49,870
Then definitely having these features in place,

465
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:53,170
you have to consider building the capacity

466
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:55,470
and these are the future plans that we have

467
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,290
to ensure that at least we maintain

468
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:02,290
what we have adapted and implemented across the facilities.

469
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,760
So, as I said, I wanted to show you,

470
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,030
I don&#39;t know other countries,

471
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:10,520
for Rwanda, this is for Rwanda.

472
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,234
You can see that even though we have

473
00:24:13,234 --> 00:24:17,870
all those good interventions in place

474
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:21,050
but we still have much more to do

475
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:25,090
when it comes to analytical features or favorite views.

476
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,690
You can see that most of the users,

477
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:28,010
they are using pivot tables

478
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:30,940
and in the system we don&#39;t have only pivot tables,

479
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,330
we have dashboards.

480
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,690
The dashboard is the black one, you can see it&#39;s still down.

481
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:39,480
So we need to have people really using the dashboards,

482
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,140
visualizer, which is the chart, maps, and others

483
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,340
that really promote the information use.

484
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,440
But we have already started this initiative

485
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,560
with University of Oslo,

486
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,380
finding out why people like to use pivot table

487
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,380
than other features.

488
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,290
That&#39;s why we can see that there are many features

489
00:24:56,290 --> 00:25:00,353
that are being released based on the field feedback.

490
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,410
So without taking long, these are the links.

491
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,543
I can share the link, but on my PowerPoint,

492
00:25:07,543 --> 00:25:09,600
I have the link where you can be able to access

493
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,050
all these tools, the SOP, the reporting form,

494
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:14,070
the metadata dictionary

495
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,520
which is the indicator reference manual,

496
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,700
the annual statistical booklet

497
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,420
that can be able to show you what we are reporting

498
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,640
and the template.

499
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,130
The list of health facilities

500
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,250
can also be found on the website.

501
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,860
So thank you.

502
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,970
Let&#39;s keep the better information,

503
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:33,460
better decisions and better health.

504
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,853
This is the end of my presentations.

505
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,510
You&#39;re welcome Scott to take over

506
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,560
and guide us to the next step, thank you.

507
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:43,440
- [Scott] No, thank you so much, Andrew.

508
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,780
Able to measure the data quality improvement

509
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:50,970
or the data use improvement over time

510
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:53,153
or how have you been able to monitor that?

511
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,860
- Okay. Thank you.

512
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,860
We, first of all, we have different articles

513
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,720
that I will share

514
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,960
that manage to measure different indicators,

515
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,230
more specifically,

516
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:13,160
we&#39;ve been working with partners in health

517
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,970
but also we have that assessment that we do,

518
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:17,623
which is the ISS.

519
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,380
When you look at the measurements

520
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:24,470
because we know we have the ranging of the score,

521
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:29,470
that when it&#39;s 5%, if the error is around zero to 5%,

522
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,330
that one is okay.

523
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,815
But if the error is above 5%,

524
00:26:35,815 --> 00:26:38,970
that one means that we need to put much efforts

525
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:43,970
to ensure that we reduce the margin of error.

526
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:49,200
So when you look at the results from the ground

527
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,160
and the study that have been done,

528
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:57,160
you can see that the data quality is pretty good

529
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:01,610
when it comes to our data that we collect from Rwanda.

530
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:04,930
But again, you know, it depends on some indicators.

531
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,080
There are some indicators that when you take them,

532
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,450
those ones that are not much more used,

533
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,200
they may be lagging behind

534
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,200
but the key indicators really have over 95% of quality.

535
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,150
- [Scott] Great, okay. Thank you.

536
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,180
A couple of additional questions.

537
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,130
What was the process that you all went through

538
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:34,110
to develop these data quality standard operating procedures

539
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,190
and how have you been able to implement them?

540
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,200
You talked a little bit about the remote training

541
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,650
but maybe you just give it a little bit more clarity

542
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:43,010
on the standard operating procedures,

543
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:43,843
how they were developed

544
00:27:43,843 --> 00:27:45,913
and how you implement them in practice?

545
00:27:49,195 --> 00:27:52,790
- That is a good question.

546
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,420
First of all, before you develop

547
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,320
even the standard operating procedures

548
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,560
you have to understand your gaps

549
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,210
and you have to understand what should you want to address?

550
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:04,050
Remember that in 2011,

551
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:06,410
it was the whole year of preparations

552
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:09,810
so we&#39;ve been really understanding the gaps that we had

553
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:14,110
and we already heard that the reporting rate was 60%.

554
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,900
So we wanted to improve the reporting rate

555
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,660
and the completeness.

556
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,120
So from there we identified different gaps.

557
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,420
One was that the reason why people are not reporting

558
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:28,340
is that they don&#39;t know their role and their responsibility.

559
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:30,250
So we said we need to come up with something

560
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,650
that really defines, what does Andrew have to do?

561
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,540
What does another person have to do?

562
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,750
What is the synergy between them?

563
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:41,730
So all of that was also part of what we wanted

564
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,940
to make sure that it&#39;s documented

565
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,690
and the process of reporting.

566
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:50,690
So again, we were also moving from a locally based system

567
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,450
to a web-based.

568
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,050
A locally based system was a little bit tricky

569
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:00,740
because by that time in 2011, before 2011,

570
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,180
we were forced to go to each facility

571
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:07,310
and install on individual computers

572
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:08,480
but now it was a web-based.

573
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,340
So we were also forced to ensure that

574
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,840
whatever that will be accessible online,

575
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,540
is it used the same way?

576
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,770
Is it standardized?

577
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:19,353
Reporting is the same,

578
00:29:19,353 --> 00:29:24,353
because we didn&#39;t have time to go and really train them

579
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,430
or mentor them at their facility.

580
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:31,430
I remember one time before 2011, there is one,

581
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,840
I always give this example,

582
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:35,540
there is one colleague of mine from one facility

583
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:41,780
that you take eight hours drive from that facility.

584
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:45,330
He came with like a flash drive,

585
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:48,550
with a backup that I have to restore in the server.

586
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,847
So at the time he was in MOH,

587
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:55,370
I checked in the flash drive there was no backup

588
00:29:57,687 --> 00:30:01,510
so it was like the virus really eaten the backup.

589
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:04,810
So the guy was forced to move again to the facility

590
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:07,250
and come back again and go back again.

591
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:09,900
You can understand the time wasted by that time.

592
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:12,590
So from there, at least when you have a web-based system,

593
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,910
you are lucky but again you have to ensure

594
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:16,350
that you have everything centralized.

595
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,204
Regarding training our team,

596
00:30:19,204 --> 00:30:23,820
because it was the first web-based system

597
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,160
that we had in the country

598
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,380
regarding the health management information system,

599
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:33,980
we were forced to really use the training of trainers,

600
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:37,160
which is the ToT and again use the training of trainers

601
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,940
to ensure that we reach everyone in the country

602
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:43,730
and we transmitted the same message, so that is what we did.

603
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:47,280
But maybe currently we have many ways that it can be done

604
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,330
but that&#39;s what we did.

605
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,056
So the SOP was much more to address the gaps

606
00:30:51,056 --> 00:30:51,889
that we identified,

607
00:30:51,889 --> 00:30:54,000
and to ensure we standardize everything

608
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,270
regarding the data management verification and others.

609
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:00,427
Because even users used to ask us,

610
00:31:00,427 --> 00:31:03,010
&quot;You are telling us to verify the data, how?&quot;

611
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:05,610
Then you could try to tell them do ABCD

612
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,660
but your colleague could also say

613
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,600
this different way to do it.

614
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,750
Then when you go down to evaluate, because we have the ISS,

615
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,457
what ISS does, which is integrated supportive supervision,

616
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,630
what did they do, they go down to access

617
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:27,230
what we documented in our SOP, is it implemented?

618
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,810
So by that time, we used to go down

619
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:31,950
and you are not able to see what to evaluate.

620
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,330
So we said, &quot;No, let&#39;s have a standard

621
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,900
that we can even go down and evaluate.

622
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,090
If we say that people have to have a meeting once a month,

623
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:40,923
is it done?

624
00:31:40,923 --> 00:31:45,180
They have to have a report documented, is it documented?&quot;

625
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,150
Those are the kinds of things

626
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,770
that we wanted to have in place,

627
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:51,627
to have evidence-based, not theory-based

628
00:31:51,627 --> 00:31:53,720
I don&#39;t know if I answered your question.

629
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:56,980
- [Scott] No, you did and I think that the clarification

630
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,410
on how you actually go down and validate

631
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:02,580
or verify what is actually the standard operating procedure

632
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:04,750
is a really good critical step.

633
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:07,630
I think from all of the case studies

634
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:08,580
that have been presented,

635
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,730
I think hopefully one of the very clear messages

636
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,220
is that standard operating procedures

637
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,900
are absolutely necessary.

638
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,400
And you&#39;ve even taken it a step further

639
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,840
by having a process to actually verify

640
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,790
if the standard operating procedure is being followed.

641
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:23,690
So I think that&#39;s really really interesting.

642
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:25,300
We have time for a couple more questions

643
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,000
and they are coming in actually quite quickly now.

644
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:34,000
One question is they are curious on how data quality is done

645
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,290
with the facility staff.

646
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:39,070
Do you call them into one place?

647
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,400
Is there a meeting?

648
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:42,480
Just what is the standard operating procedure

649
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,010
for the actual facility staff

650
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:46,093
for them to conduct data quality checks?

651
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,460
- Thank you, Scott.

652
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,290
That is a good question again.

653
00:32:51,290 --> 00:32:55,490
So what we did, we have two ways.

654
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,610
One is that we already have the data checks

655
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,870
that is documented in our SOP

656
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:05,870
which requires certain group of people

657
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:09,850
like if it&#39;s a hospital, we require the chief nursing,

658
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,230
the clinical director, the data manager, the M&amp;E,

659
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,730
and some people in the services who records the data

660
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:18,980
to come together and review the data

661
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,530
before they report them into HMIS.

662
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:24,610
And this one is done either before fifth,

663
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,060
because fifth is when we say that they have

664
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:31,010
reported on timely basis but we give them at least 15 days.

665
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:33,430
It means from 1st to 15th,

666
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,360
they have to undergo that process.

667
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,430
At least within those 15 days, they have to sit down,

668
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:44,430
those key people I mentioned and I&#39;ve even shown the picture

669
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:47,440
and they review.

670
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:50,050
Reviewing means they bring the register

671
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:53,570
and check if what they really counted

672
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,640
is the same as what they reported.

673
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:58,640
So, but again, after that meeting,

674
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,950
they have what you call coordination meeting.

675
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,200
The coordination meeting

676
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,390
is the same as the previous meeting,

677
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,400
only that the previous meeting

678
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,720
focuses on the quality of data,

679
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:11,580
checking if there&#39;s anything that you reported wrongly.

680
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:14,850
But the coordination meeting is the catchment area meeting

681
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,350
where it brings together with the health center

682
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:18,790
in that catchment area,

683
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,120
then what they do is that the M&amp;E and the hospital

684
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,890
presents the key indicators

685
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:26,740
saying that, for example,

686
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:30,030
we had three maternal deaths, maybe last month

687
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,580
and the first month it was one maternal death.

688
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,500
Then they may ask some people in the maternity

689
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,590
why it happened, then they have to explain.

690
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:40,510
Then when they&#39;re explaining, they take some actions.

691
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,087
Those actions, at least they may say,

692
00:34:42,087 --> 00:34:45,030
&quot;We have to improve the case management in maternity,

693
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:50,030
we have to improve the way we treat the mothers.

694
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,700
We have ensure that the ambulance,

695
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,680
when they are going to transfer mother to their facility,

696
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,310
it doesn&#39;t take long.&quot;

697
00:34:56,310 --> 00:35:01,310
Those are the kinds of discussion that they have.

698
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,350
Then at the end of the day, they take also actions.

699
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:07,470
At least those actions are on top of the real data

700
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:09,270
that they took from the system.

701
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,820
Again, in case, they reported the wrong number,

702
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:15,227
you can understand that someone in maternity will say,

703
00:35:15,227 --> 00:35:20,227
&quot;No, we didn&#39;t have four maternal deaths, we only had one.

704
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:23,830
So I need to understand where three are coming from.&quot;

705
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,610
So those are kinds of discussion they discuss.

706
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:29,540
But again, it is one, is just improving the quality of data.

707
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:32,540
The second one is improving both the information use,

708
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,040
which is the actions.

709
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:36,840
Then again, also checking if what data says

710
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:41,840
is people think that they have in their services.

711
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:46,070
So I think that is what I could say that we have,

712
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,033
but again, as you said, Scott,

713
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:51,970
whatever that is written in SOP

714
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:54,250
is evaluated after six months.

715
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,670
So each six months we go down,

716
00:35:56,670 --> 00:35:59,290
which is the ISS, integrated supportive supervision,

717
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,590
with development partners,

718
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,850
then we check if they are really implementing

719
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:05,810
what is written in SOP.

720
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:08,530
At least that one makes them to really make sure that

721
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:11,870
whatever we have in the SOP is implemented and is used

722
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,120
and also we ensure that the SOP

723
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,860
also defines well those kinds of meetings of data checks

724
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:21,500
and what did they have to check and who chairs the meeting.

725
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,870
If the person who chairs the meeting is not around,

726
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:26,300
who replaced that person.

727
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,459
After the meeting,

728
00:36:27,459 --> 00:36:32,459
you have seen that we have appendixes of the report,

729
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:35,770
the type of the report that they have to document,

730
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,060
actions that they have to take,

731
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:39,320
how they have to conduct the next meeting

732
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,440
by reviewing the previous actions.

733
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,940
Those are things that we manage to document well

734
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,260
to ensure that it also guides the facilities.

735
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,093
Thank you.

736
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,050
- [Scott] Great, that&#39;s very, very clear. Thank you, Andrew.

737
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:53,710
We have time for one more question.

738
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:58,283
And I think the question is,

739
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,210
what is your experience in sharing data with stakeholders?

740
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,020
Maybe implementing partners, NGOs,

741
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,470
how do you regulate the number of data managers

742
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,303
in the system?

743
00:37:09,303 --> 00:37:12,383
And do you have any challenges with this?

744
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,810
- Yeah, that&#39;s a good question

745
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:20,810
that is a discussion everywhere that I&#39;ve really visited.

746
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:26,000
So for the facilities and district it&#39;s by default.

747
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:28,450
All of them they have to have access

748
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:31,240
and we give them access, it doesn&#39;t require anything

749
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:34,490
because the data that they report

750
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,470
is from their institutions.

751
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,550
But when it comes to development partners,

752
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,442
we also have this mandate

753
00:37:41,442 --> 00:37:43,629
of ensuring the development partners

754
00:37:43,629 --> 00:37:47,374
are also part of the process that we undergo.

755
00:37:47,374 --> 00:37:49,874
So what we do is that in HMIS,

756
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:53,830
we have a focal person

757
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:57,758
that is assigned to each development partner

758
00:37:57,758 --> 00:38:00,880
that ensures that whatever requests they need

759
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,800
is shared with them.

760
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:06,590
So if today we have a new NGO

761
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:09,130
that&#39;s coming through to support the health sector,

762
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,920
what they do, they just do a request.

763
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,417
They just do a request where you say that,

764
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:19,310
&quot;I&#39;ll be needing this data to monitor our interventions.&quot;

765
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:22,720
So what we do we also respond back and say,

766
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,717
I mean, the minister of health responsible can say,

767
00:38:24,717 --> 00:38:26,870
&quot;We will be giving you this data.

768
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:30,410
Please contact this focal person

769
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:32,870
that will be ensuring that whatever that I need

770
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,370
is on your disposal.

771
00:38:34,370 --> 00:38:36,730
It doesn&#39;t take when you&#39;re going through the processes.&quot;

772
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,930
So that&#39;s how we are doing it

773
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:41,480
but currently we are not giving access to everyone

774
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,267
to have access in the system.

775
00:38:43,267 --> 00:38:46,520
We are ensuring that accessing this system is limited,

776
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:50,730
but in a way that we are able to serve our stakeholders

777
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:54,880
by assigning the focal person.

778
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,880
But again, we are now developing the data warehouse,

779
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,370
which is the the portal

780
00:39:02,370 --> 00:39:04,810
that will be making some of the data

781
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:07,420
to be available to the partners

782
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,050
but again we also have a mandate

783
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:13,720
or obligations of ensuring that on annual basis,

784
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,270
we publish the statistical booklet that really highlights

785
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:21,043
all key indicators that anyone, a researcher or DP,

786
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:24,781
which is the partners, can be able to use

787
00:39:24,781 --> 00:39:27,720
when they are reviewing their interventions.

788
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,553
Thank you.

789
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,740
- [Scott] Okay, and sorry, one last question here.

790
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,573
I think it&#39;s a good question,

791
00:39:33,573 --> 00:39:36,010
one that I was wondering about myself.

792
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:41,010
Is there any penalty or are there any rewards

793
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:44,150
for actually following the SOPs

794
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:45,900
or if they&#39;re not actually following the SOPs,

795
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,270
are there any penalties

796
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:52,270
when you do the actual like go into the field, the ISS?

797
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,720
- That&#39;s another one.

798
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,720
So what we did was in linking together

799
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,300
some of these mechanisms or framework

800
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:09,083
that we have accountability framework.

801
00:40:10,853 --> 00:40:13,620
I think for us, what we have in Rwanda

802
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,500
is that each staff have what we call KPI,

803
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,963
key performance indicator.

804
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,320
Like if I&#39;m Andrew working in the facility,

805
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,740
I have a key performance indicator,

806
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,230
and my key performance indicator is linked to my TOR

807
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:33,560
and what I have to deliver on daily basis, so that&#39;s one.

808
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,560
And we have some portion of what we call PBF,

809
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:43,850
performance based financing, that is linked to my KPI,

810
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:46,990
which is performance based financing.

811
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:50,481
But it&#39;s not only that we have managed

812
00:40:50,481 --> 00:40:53,880
to link all those mechanism

813
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:58,880
that really promotes the good quality data or reporting,

814
00:40:59,030 --> 00:41:00,540
two different mechanisms.

815
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,940
One is performance based financing,

816
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:06,000
where people are evaluated on quarterly basis

817
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,840
based on different indicators.

818
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,280
Like in data management,

819
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,920
for us we have like three indicators,

820
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,870
I mean for data quality,

821
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:18,040
completeness, timelines, and accuracy.

822
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,347
All those three indicators

823
00:41:19,347 --> 00:41:21,100
are in performance-based financing.

824
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,970
In case one indicator is not well done, you get zero

825
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,250
so there&#39;s no tolerance.

826
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,110
So it means they have to make sure

827
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,810
that all those key indicators are reported

828
00:41:31,810 --> 00:41:34,890
and really reported well.

829
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:38,130
So if it&#39;s timeliness, you reported on time, 100%.

830
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:41,500
If it&#39;s accuracy, at least you&#39;re in a range of 5%.

831
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:45,910
If it&#39;s completeness, you&#39;re on range of 100%,

832
00:41:45,910 --> 00:41:47,900
then that&#39;s when you get 100%.

833
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:52,200
But if one of those is maybe 80 or 60,

834
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,140
you&#39;ll get zero for everything.

835
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,270
So it means you have to make sure that everything is 100%.

836
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,240
Another thing is that accreditation,

837
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,430
we have managed to link also with accreditation.

838
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:07,050
In accreditation when they&#39;re trying to move facilities

839
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,880
from level one to level two, level three, level four,

840
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,550
they also review these tools.

841
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:13,780
They have to check if you have SOP in place.

842
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:16,880
They have to check if you understand the chapters of SOP.

843
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,550
They have to see if you undergo

844
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:20,630
the process of what SOP says.

845
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,170
They check different components

846
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,960
but also when it comes to data management,

847
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,330
they check those areas.

848
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:28,860
At least that one, when like me, I&#39;m in a facility A

849
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,000
and I see that my components

850
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,760
really made my facility to go in level two,

851
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,800
it is also a motivation.

852
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:39,790
Another one is this is where we are bringing the e-learning.

853
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,770
They&#39;ve been telling us that we train them

854
00:42:41,770 --> 00:42:43,530
but we don&#39;t give them a certificate.

855
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:45,650
Now we are trying to keep the database

856
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,950
that also highlights who were trained

857
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,110
in the specific period of time

858
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:53,020
but also they get certificates.

859
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,100
So those are things that really motivate the facilities&#39;

860
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:59,100
interlinked frameworks that are in place

861
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:01,360
that motivates the facilities.

862
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,940
And as you go on,

863
00:43:02,940 --> 00:43:07,940
people start having the attitude of doing it themselves.

864
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:11,000
Maybe one time when you visit us,

865
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:13,340
you will see that when it comes to first and fifth,

866
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:14,990
when you go to facility,

867
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:18,460
everyone will be telling you, &quot;Oh, we are late to report.&quot;

868
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,320
They will be really rushing

869
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,170
to ensure that they report on time

870
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,950
and ensure that everything is really accurate

871
00:43:23,950 --> 00:43:26,910
because you know, on quarterly basis and six months,

872
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,080
there are a team of people

873
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,400
that will go down to check if what they reported

874
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,060
is the same as what they have.

875
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,750
And another thing is that after the ISS,

876
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:37,280
which is integrated supportive supervision,

877
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,320
the feedback is submitted officially,

878
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,610
it&#39;s the minister who signs the feedback.

879
00:43:42,610 --> 00:43:44,730
It means, imagine if I&#39;m Andrew

880
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:46,120
and I see the letter of the minister

881
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:49,300
saying that my department is not performing well.

882
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,790
So they really make sure that the feedback

883
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:53,120
comes when it&#39;s positive

884
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,610
instead of coming when it&#39;s negative.

885
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:58,670
Another thing is that we don&#39;t only report

886
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,620
what they have done specifically,

887
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,940
we also get the general feedback

888
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,570
that can improve the system.

889
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:08,760
So we say, &quot;Generally we find that people don&#39;t conduct

890
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:11,990
maybe data validation meetings.&quot;

891
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:14,210
So it becomes like a general feedback.

892
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:15,370
That one also improves

893
00:44:15,370 --> 00:44:18,100
because you get your specific feedback

894
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,870
but again, so you get the general feedback too,

895
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,600
that we have found everywhere

896
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,250
but at least you make sure that the next time

897
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:25,450
it&#39;s not also you

898
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:28,830
who is going to be highlighted in the report.

899
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,640
So I think those are the key things,

900
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,918
we have other steps like development partners

901
00:44:33,918 --> 00:44:35,940
in their support area,

902
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,040
they also conduct the self checks

903
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:42,250
to ensure that people understand how to check this data.

904
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:46,370
We have districts that supervises lower levels.

905
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:48,500
We have lower levels, the district hospitals

906
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,990
that supervises the health centers

907
00:44:51,990 --> 00:44:54,597
and all of this is also documented in SOP.

908
00:44:54,597 --> 00:44:56,210
And we also go down and check

909
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:59,650
if the hospitals really supervise their health centers.

910
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:03,000
All those mechanism that brings in the supervision,

911
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,690
accountability, roles and responsibility,

912
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:08,090
contributes a lot when it comes to data quality.

913
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:15,120
- [Scott] That is the best way to end the entire academy.

914
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,310
Andrew, you actually have the honor

915
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:19,510
of being the very last presentation in the entire academy

916
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:22,110
and I think this is a really great one to end it on.
