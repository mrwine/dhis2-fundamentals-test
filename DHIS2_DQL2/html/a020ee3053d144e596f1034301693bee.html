<p class= "text">In this video, Yury will show you how you can turn Tracker data into aggregate data. You’ll start by looking at the Data Import tool in DHIS2 that you can use to import the Tracker data, then work through an example of the data being imported with it. You’ll then look at how to use the Tracker to Aggregate script to map the Tracker data into useful aggregate data.</p>
