0
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:02,780
- So the last thing that I wanted to talk about

1
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,760
are some supplemental scripts

2
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,010
that have been developed to support

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:11,690
the assessment of DHIS2 system design.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:14,500
And these dig a little bit deeper

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,310
than what the data integrity check provides.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,220
And it also provides you a bit of a summary

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,550
that you can present to others

8
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,110
that is more easily digestible I think in a lot of ways,

9
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,750
because you can enumerate the results

10
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,560
that are outputted by these queries.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,020
So I&#39;ve shared the SQL file for you here.

12
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,460
There&#39;re series of SQL queries and one of the challenges is

13
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,140
that you need direct database access to run some of these.

14
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,960
So for example, you can run any query on users

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,670
via an SQL view within DHIS2.

16
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,640
So this is not something necessarily

17
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,140
that everyone will be able to do,

18
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,950
but it&#39;s good to be aware that this is a possibility

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:00,910
because you can always enlist a little bit of help

20
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,300
in making sure that you can do this.

21
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:06,810
So I&#39;m going to transfer over to the interface

22
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,880
where I can run some SQL queries essentially.

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,940
So you can see this in operation on a system

24
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,650
and kind of understand some of the outputs.

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,560
So it assesses a number of different things.

26
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,120
There&#39;s a data set, state elements, indicators,

27
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,012
users, organization units, dashboards, charts,

28
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:26,850
pivot tables, and maps.

29
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,680
So we can see there&#39;s a lot of stuff related

30
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:32,620
to analytical outputs, as well as things like

31
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,670
our data sets and our data elements.

32
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,090
Now you can see once again, in terms of input,

33
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,360
there&#39;s a big focus on aggregate data,

34
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,780
but I think this helps us really

35
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,840
to summarize some key issues that we might see in the system

36
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,590
when we&#39;re actually performing this type of assessment.

37
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,570
Okay, so we&#39;re getting a bit technical now.

38
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,560
This might not be something that everyone&#39;s familiar with

39
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,470
or that they&#39;re available to perform

40
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,700
without a little bit of support, but that&#39;s okay.

41
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,900
What we really want to impart is that

42
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,810
these tools are available

43
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,220
and someone can help you to implement them.

44
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,660
But because the queries are already there

45
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,770
for anyone who&#39;s familiar with doing this,

46
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:14,480
it&#39;s basically just something you can copy

47
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,380
and paste when you&#39;re running these

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,910
so you can get the output.

49
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,600
So the output&#39;s located at the--

50
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,380
so I&#39;ve run one query on datasets

51
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,570
just to show you an example.

52
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,970
I&#39;ll run another one in a moment,

53
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:27,900
just so you can kinda see how it operates.

54
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,220
So, I&#39;ve just pasted in the query.

55
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,970
And then I have the results at the bottom.

56
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,470
This is a query on datasets

57
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,730
and it gives me a bit of information

58
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,760
that isn&#39;t present in the data integrity checks.

59
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,960
So here I have the number of datasets,

60
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,910
the total number of data sets.

61
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:49,300
I have something called datasets abandoned

62
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,510
and it gives me a description of what that is.

63
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,110
Data sets that have not been changed in the last 100 days

64
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,690
and they&#39;re assigned to one or less org units.

65
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:02,480
We then have under this dataset, no updated data.

66
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,850
Datasets with no data values with the last updated date

67
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,810
within the last three periods

68
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,813
based on the data set period type.

69
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,580
And then the final one, dataset with no new data,

70
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,763
datasets with no data values in the last three periods.

71
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,010
So this is helping me to identify basically

72
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,320
items that are not being utilized.

73
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,720
We can think about how this might affect

74
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,683
our completeness for example.

75
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,110
If these datasets are not being utilized

76
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,510
and we check the completeness of this data,

77
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:36,870
it&#39;s probably going to be pretty low.

78
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:39,343
So the reasoning behind that,

79
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,800
there could be different reasonings behind

80
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,000
why that&#39;s not being used, but it might not be

81
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,170
that this dataset is even being utilized anymore.

82
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:52,610
So, if that&#39;s the case then what do we do

83
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,640
with these data sets where there&#39;s no new values

84
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,650
for such a long period of time.

85
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,940
And you can see this as more of a summary,

86
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,750
but this allows you to assess and summarize and share

87
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,410
some of these kind of top level issues with others.

88
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,870
I&#39;m just going to run another query.

89
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,340
So this is the file here,

90
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,493
I&#39;ll run it for data elements, for example.

91
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:19,530
Just copy the whole thing.

92
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:20,363
Sorry.

93
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,703
Copy it all.

94
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,090
And I&#39;m gonna run the query again.

95
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:27,000
I&#39;m just gonna paste it right in there.

96
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,570
It&#39;s gonna give me by output at the bottom,

97
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,710
and this is for data elements.

98
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,238
And you can see the summary of what it&#39;s produced,

99
00:04:34,238 --> 00:04:36,010
total number of data elements,

100
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,053
data elements not in any groups.

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,480
And then it has a number of listings

102
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,060
for aggregate to data elements in particular.

103
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,220
Aggregate dated elements that are not assigned

104
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,963
to any organization units,

105
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,873
aggregate data elements with no data values.

106
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,840
Aggregate data elements with no data values

107
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,140
in the last three periods.

108
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,770
And the period type is based upon the data set itself.

109
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,390
So the last three periods could be the last three months,

110
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:09,830
if the data set is monthly, and it will be quarterly,

111
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,960
of course, the last three quarters perhaps,

112
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,410
if the data set is quarterly.

113
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,120
So you can see what kind of outputs that this produces.

114
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,420
So there&#39;s a number of queries there.

115
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,770
Maybe not everyone&#39;s going to be able to run them,

116
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:28,580
but if you can, I would suggest maybe on a local instance,

117
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,800
for example, you can run some of these queries

118
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,700
just to see the output and see

119
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,150
if this kind of helps you understand the setup

120
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:39,900
of the database you&#39;re working with a little bit more.

121
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:43,510
I think it also presents quite easy to understand

122
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,910
outputs for others to kind of review.

123
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,850
So it&#39;s not just something internally,

124
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,820
even though maybe they might need

125
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,720
a little bit of help producing these outputs.

126
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,990
I think that is something very nice

127
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,150
to present to others at a top level.

128
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,120
Obviously you will have to investigate.

129
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,120
For example, if you say, this last row in this table,

130
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,100
data element, no analysis.

131
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:11,440
There&#39;s 110 of these data elements that are not used

132
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,090
in any favorites, either directly or through indicators.

133
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:16,530
So you&#39;re gonna have to investigate

134
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,890
what are those data elements that aren&#39;t being used.

135
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:22,310
But at a very top level I think it&#39;s it&#39;s quite easy

136
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,850
to present these summaries and say,

137
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,460
this is why we might need to consider making some changes.

138
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,310
We have all this kind of abandoned,

139
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,070
disparate metadata in our system

140
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,840
that&#39;s just causing all kinds of problems,

141
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,193
and what do we do with it?

142
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:42,090
So, those are some of the tools you can use

143
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,050
in order to assess this a little bit more.

144
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,186
These SQL queries, you can run some as SQL views,

145
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:51,700
but there are some that you just cannot.

146
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,100
It will not allow you to do to the tables

147
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,030
that you&#39;re accessing.

148
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:59,330
So, the most foolproof way to make sure

149
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,290
you can run all of them is to have direct database access.

150
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:04,570
And then of course, you can run them directly

151
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,283
and get the output that you need.

152
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,240
So, the whole point of this was just to make you aware

153
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,050
that these tools are available.

154
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,400
Might not be the case where

155
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,140
you&#39;re actually doing this yourself.

156
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,560
It might be the case of course, where you are.

157
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,540
But now that you know they are available,

158
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:26,543
it&#39;s just another kind of way to help you assess the system.
