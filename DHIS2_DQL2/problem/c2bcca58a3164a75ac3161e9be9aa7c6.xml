  <label>What is one method we can use to control which data elements can have data entered in them that is not available on a paper/source form? (2 attempts)</label>

<div class="detailed-solution">
<p>Explanation</p>

<p> </p>
  <p><b>Grey cells can be used to easily block data elements or disaggregations from being entered</b>. Validation rules can be used to check data, but can not be used to block a single data element from being entered. Section forms are a type of form we can make, they do not control what can be entered</p>
