00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:08,020
- With this video, I&#39;m going to demonstrate

1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:11,618
how to use the outliers page of the dashboard,

2
00:00:11,618 --> 00:00:16,370
of the WHO Data Quality Tool.

3
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,370
We&#39;ve set the dashboard with data set to core,

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,400
period set to June,

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,690
organization unit with a national boundary,

6
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:29,993
and disaggregation to district.

7
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,590
So if we click on the outliers tab,

8
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:39,333
and wait a bit for the moving rectangle to disappear,

9
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,683
we will see a result table,

10
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,590
so that we can see

11
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,410
all of the result table, it&#39;s best to make

12
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,040
the settings window disappear, by clicking

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,913
on the settings icon.

14
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:58,750
The result table has a large number of rows, as you see.

15
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,610
And in fact, it even spills over into more than one page.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,760
And the result table consists of rows like this,

17
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,340
with 12 monthly values,

18
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,410
and one or more of the cells,

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:21,473
one or more of the values is highlighted in red.

20
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:26,000
These values highlighted in red are outliers.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,330
They are suspicious because they are different from the

22
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,253
values reported for other months.

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,830
We&#39;ve set this aggregation to district.

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:41,830
So each row presents results for one district,

25
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,870
and for one indicator or data element.

26
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:50,870
And here you see the 12 monthly values leading up to

27
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,343
June of 2020, the period that we have selected.

28
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:59,930
If we want to see how different this value

29
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,940
is from the normal values,

30
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,410
the other values reported in other months,

31
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:11,410
we can use that menu at the end of the row

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,513
and select visualize.

33
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:20,010
We then see this chart showing that in January of 2020,

34
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,660
the ANC 1 visits of district B2 were quite different

35
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,880
from the values reported in other months.

36
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,520
This of course is that outlier that we found when looking

37
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,520
at the consistency time and consistency data pages

38
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,240
of the dashboard of the WHO Data Quality Tool.

39
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,980
So the same outlier keeps appearing in different ways

40
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,510
on the different dashboards.

41
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:52,240
And here we see how very different it is

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,990
from the ANC 1 visits reported in other months

43
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:57,083
by district B2.

44
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,363
We can make this chart disappear by clicking on close.

45
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,420
Notice this options button,

46
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,650
the options button allows you to reveal additional

47
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:12,090
information in your results table,

48
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:15,113
and it allows you to filter the results table.

49
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,170
One of the boxes in the options field,

50
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:25,170
options window, is this one to include the Z-score.

51
00:03:25,607 --> 00:03:29,270
The Z-score as a measure of how suspicious

52
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:33,340
the red value is. The higher the Z-score,

53
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,970
the more suspicious it is, and a standard Z-score

54
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,500
of three or more is extremely suspicious.

55
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,000
So the, we see that this top row

56
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:47,860
of the result table has quite

57
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,570
a high value of the standard Z-score

58
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:52,410
and the modified Z-score,

59
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,010
which is simply another way of measuring how suspicious

60
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,590
that value is.

61
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,170
In fact, the tool automatically sorts these

62
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,210
suspicious values so that the most suspicious of all

63
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,660
is placed right at the top.

64
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,325
So the tool automatically finds the outliers that deserve

65
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,423
the most attention.

66
00:04:19,112 --> 00:04:22,460
We can also filter this table.

67
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:25,823
Now we&#39;ve got so many rows and as I say,

68
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:31,670
it continues on multiple pages, three pages

69
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:37,130
we can in order to find only the most

70
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:42,130
suspicious values, we can filter by clicking as follows.

71
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,743
First, we say, we only want to see the outliers.

72
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,910
We will only want to see those that

73
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:52,973
have a modified Z-score that&#39;s extreme.

74
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:59,150
What this does is it only shows you the rows which have a

75
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:03,340
modified Z-score of greater than five

76
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,340
and notice that there is a much smaller results table

77
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,940
when we limit it to rows with

78
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,893
a modified Z-score of greater than five.

79
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,840
There&#39;s one other thing that you can do

80
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,840
with the outlier page of the dashboard,

81
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:26,070
and that is you can drill down.

82
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:28,750
What do we mean by drill down?

83
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,280
Well at present the,

84
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,540
each row shows you the values for the district.

85
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:38,390
And we may want to know which specific health facility or

86
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,390
health facilities is responsible for this extreme outlier.

87
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,500
And to do that, we click on the menu

88
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,210
at the end of the row and select drill down.

89
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:53,453
Notice what happens.

90
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,400
We get a table which has rows,

91
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,363
all for district B2,

92
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,180
but each row is for one health facility in district B2.

93
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,040
We could filter this if we only wanted to see the rows

94
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,060
that had very high modified Z-scores.

95
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,550
And right at the top,

96
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,800
we see that facility 147,

97
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,370
is the one that reported

98
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,940
35,888 first ANC visits.

99
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,170
And compared to the values reported in other months,

100
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,670
we see that this is almost certainly an error.

101
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:40,000
Perhaps some people added some extra eights when this,

102
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,960
when these data were entered.

103
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,896
And this is why this extreme outlier has appeared in the

104
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:50,003
dataset. In fact, if we visualized it,

105
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:55,163
we&#39;d see this really very suspicious chart.

106
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:59,250
There&#39;s another thing we can do with this menu

107
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,870
at the end of the row.

108
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,870
And that is we can actually send a message through

109
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:08,520
the dhis2 internal messaging service,

110
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,520
and we can contact the person who&#39;s responsible for the data

111
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,830
in that district.

112
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:20,370
So we could select the data manager for district B2

113
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,600
and type a message in here

114
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,950
We want to specify the, the health facility, the dates,

115
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,360
the value, and ask them to please report back.

116
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,653
And then we could send this message.

117
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,693
Through the dhis2 internal messaging service.

118
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,780
Notice that some of the cells of the results table are

119
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:55,323
colored pale yellow and have missing values.

120
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:01,140
Missing values are highlighted in this way.

121
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,760
And the outlier page can also be used

122
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,810
to identify health facilities,

123
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:12,810
which have large amounts of incomplete or missing data.

124
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,830
To do this, you turn off the outlier filter

125
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:21,260
under options and click on missing data,

126
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,990
and the results table now shows at the top,

127
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:29,100
those health facilities and those indicators

128
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,983
for which the monthly values have not been reported.

129
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:41,060
One final feature of the outlier page is the download button

130
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,750
by clicking on this

131
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,810
and then clicking download a second time,

132
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,610
we generate what is called a CSV file,

133
00:08:52,610 --> 00:08:55,763
which is like an excel file.

134
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:01,050
This excel file is on the computer. It&#39;s not online,

135
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:05,550
so it can be viewed even when not connected to the internet.

136
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,693
If we open it,

137
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:21,410
we see a typical spreadsheet and like any excel spreadsheet,

138
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:25,963
you can use the data sort functions.

139
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:32,990
To arrange these, by such things as the modified Z-score.

140
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:41,817
Now we see once again, the health facility, B2,

141
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:47,083
which has this very large ANC first visit value,

142
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:57,080
or we could sort the spreadsheet according

143
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,913
to missing values.

144
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,150
But it&#39;s called the gap weight,

145
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,913
which is the total amount of missing data.

146
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,380
And now we&#39;ve identified this health facility again,

147
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:17,380
it has a series of months without data.

148
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:29,400
So returning to the outlier page,

149
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,913
let&#39;s summarize,

150
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:39,850
the outlier page is probably

151
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:44,423
the most powerful of the tools of the dashboard.

152
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,970
It allows you to quickly and automatically identify

153
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:52,940
the most suspicious values,

154
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,800
not only at the level of the district,

155
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:59,080
but you can easily drill down and identify

156
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:01,250
the specific health facility,

157
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,130
which has reported the suspicious value.

158
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,220
And you can identify health facilities with large amounts

159
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,493
of missing data.

160
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,580
This is the final page of the dashboard

161
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,630
of the WHO Data Quality Tool,

162
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:23,630
we&#39;ve seen how it is possible to quickly make use

163
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:28,950
of the data quality review functions.

164
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:33,770
And it doesn&#39;t require any configuration on the part of the

165
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:37,630
user other than to set the data group,

166
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,303
the period and the organization unit.

167
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:49,590
This makes the tool quite useful for

168
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:54,400
those who would want to quickly use

169
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,420
the WHO Data Quality Tool routinely,

170
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,210
every month to find the most suspicious values.

171
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:06,500
And we will show you in a subsequent session,

172
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,460
how to quickly train district staff to use

173
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,273
the outlier dashboard in particular.

174
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,010
However, one of the limitations of the dashboard,

175
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:22,130
is that it permits you only to look at those indicators,

176
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,103
which have been configured for the dashboard.

177
00:12:25,990 --> 00:12:30,190
In the next session, we&#39;re going to demonstrate

178
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,640
how to use the analysis function,

179
