00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,763
- [Bob] Good day. This is Bob Pond.

2
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:11,840
I&#39;m going to be presenting

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,840
on how to use the WHO Data Quality Tool.

4
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:22,930
We have shared with you the document that you see here,

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
which is a guide on how to use the WHO Data Quality Tool,

6
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:34,830
and it includes a lot of screenshots

7
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,210
that take you through step by step how

8
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,210
to practice exactly what I&#39;m going to be presenting on.

9
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:46,600
You see at the beginning of the guide,

10
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,600
there is a URL where you can log into a special instance

11
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:57,120
of DHIS2 even after this academy.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,770
If you log in there, use the demo,

13
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,600
use the username and password that are on the log in page,

14
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,240
and even those who are not here

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,730
at the academy should be able to practice these steps.

16
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:14,960
In this first presentation,

17
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,253
I&#39;m going to cover how to use the Completeness dashboard.

18
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,320
Then we will go over the Consistency-time dashboard

19
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:29,960
and onwards with the various sections

20
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,770
that you see here in the table of contents of the tool.

21
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,083
So without delaying further,

22
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,800
let&#39;s take a look at this special instance

23
00:01:44,092 --> 00:01:47,080
of DHIS2, which has been set up for you

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,713
to practice data quality assessment.

25
00:01:50,713 --> 00:01:53,296
