<h3>Standard Deviation Predictors</h3>
<p class= "text">In this video, Scott shows you different approaches for isolating outliers using dashboards and the Data Visualizer app. You’ll start by looking at outlier examples and how they affect Data Quality. Then, you’ll learn how to configure and use predictors to calculate outlier thresholds, with guidance for scheduling predictors, analytics tables and validation rule alerts. The last 10 minutes include a Questions and Answers session with academy participants that covers how to make a cron expression for DHIS2, among other topics.</p>
