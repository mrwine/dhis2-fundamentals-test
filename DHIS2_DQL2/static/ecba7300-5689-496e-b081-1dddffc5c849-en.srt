00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:02,950
- [Instructor] So another issue that you might find

1
00:00:02,950 --> 00:00:05,630
is dealing with data dimensions.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,440
So there are really three areas that you can define

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,160
what&#39;s a data dimension

4
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,500
to be used in analytics ops in DHIS2.

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,100
This includes our categories,

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,760
category option group sets,

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,283
and our organization unit group sets.

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:27,850
This all affects what is essentially the left side menu

9
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,200
that users see when they&#39;re performing analysis

10
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,280
on various items in these apps.

11
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,540
And if this becomes so large that people cannot

12
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,390
make heads or tails of what they&#39;re seeing,

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:43,330
then it&#39;s not really kind of being used

14
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:44,640
in the way it should be.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,660
The whole idea is that we want these dimensions

16
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:48,970
to be present so people can drill down,

17
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:51,210
can desegregate their data in the way that&#39;s necessary

18
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,160
to support their analysis requirements.

19
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,420
If they&#39;re not able to find what they need,

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,360
this is going to have some impact on

21
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,843
how they actually utilize the system itself.

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,360
So it can affect data quality,

23
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,880
but this is also a bit of a user issue as well

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,020
in terms of what they&#39;re seeing.

25
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:11,270
And if this list, in this example here,

26
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,990
that you can see there&#39;s kind of top and bottoms

27
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,280
to this list, but I can keep scrolling down

28
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,460
and more and more would be there.

29
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:22,500
So one way to do this obviously is if you&#39;re sharing

30
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,930
and we&#39;ll talk a bit about sharing more,

31
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:26,540
but you can choose to share

32
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,840
which data dimensions people see.

33
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,620
So they&#39;re not seeing everything.

34
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:33,850
They&#39;re only seeing the ones that are relevant to them.

35
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,500
But one of the main problems with DHIS2

36
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,030
is that for all three of these items, categories,

37
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,600
category option group sets,

38
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,500
and organization unit group sets,

39
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:46,480
they have this data dimension checkbox ticked by default.

40
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,980
So anytime I go to create a new one,

41
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,930
it&#39;s just going to appear on that menu,

42
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:53,430
and it&#39;s going to get larger and larger and larger

43
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:57,140
until it&#39;s basically I cannot navigate or find anything

44
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,160
that I need, or at least not easily,

45
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,063
unless I really know the system well.

46
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:04,320
So, one thing that I often like to do

47
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,580
is make sure to incorporate whether or not to select this

48
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,540
in a data dimension.

49
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,410
So that&#39;s standard operating procedure

50
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,243
that I shared with you.

51
00:02:12,243 --> 00:02:14,120
We&#39;ll just go back to that real quick.

52
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,930
I made sure that I highlight that you have to decide

53
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:23,540
whether or not you should use a data dimension

54
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,760
for that particular item that you&#39;re creating.

55
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,420
Because if not, if you just go to create a new category

56
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,140
or an organization unit group set,

57
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:34,380
or a category option group set,

58
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,180
it&#39;s going to add it to that left menu.

59
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,880
And this is going to cause some challenges

60
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,190
with the ability to find what you need

61
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,190
in order to analyze your data correctly.

62
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:49,490
Another challenge that we might see related to system design

63
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:52,300
and data quality is when we find a lot of

64
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,900
duplicate data elements.

65
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,023
So just in this example here,

66
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,950
I have a number of duplicate data elements

67
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:03,380
that are storing or representing,

68
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,210
I should say, the same item.

69
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,940
They&#39;re all about maternal deaths.

70
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:10,680
Every single one of these items that I see here

71
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,610
is related to maternal deaths.

72
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:15,320
And in fact, it&#39;s just representing the same,

73
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:18,370
basically the same concept.

74
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,010
So what do I do in this scenario?

75
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,900
Now, this is a bit more complicated

76
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,840
because these different data elements

77
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,170
can belong to different programs.

78
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:29,560
They might belong to the same program.

79
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:32,178
It might be reported a couple of different times

80
00:03:32,178 --> 00:03:35,940
in the same system, but they might belong to different

81
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,570
programs as well.

82
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:39,890
And the challenge here is that different programs

83
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,230
will then be reporting different values potentially.

84
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,620
And you&#39;re not actually sure then in this scenario,

85
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:46,610
what is the source?

86
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,690
What is the source of truth for this particular data item?

87
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,980
You don&#39;t really know when there&#39;s so many different values

88
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:55,350
that represent the same concept.

89
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,110
You can kind of pick and choose,

90
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,210
and programs kind of do this because they&#39;re stuck with

91
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,930
the item that they&#39;re really the ones responsible for

92
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:05,800
or feel they&#39;re responsible for.

93
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,670
But in an integrated system,

94
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:09,520
this is not really the best approach.

95
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:14,280
So this is more a measure to identify this problem.

96
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,880
I can&#39;t say I have an immediate solution

97
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,690
for rectifying this issue,

98
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,220
because this is not something that can be done quickly.

99
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,390
You cannot just take all these data elements

100
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,780
and collapse them.

101
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,970
You&#39;re gonna have all kinds of different values.

102
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,690
Potentially you&#39;re gonna have different programs

103
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:32,680
that are responsible for kind of maintaining these as well.

104
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,220
So there&#39;s not an easy workaround that I personally

105
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,550
can recommend to you on this,

106
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,920
but this is just something that you really should look for

107
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:44,390
and try to help over time countries and other partners

108
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:45,550
fix this type of issue.

109
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,990
Because this becomes very challenging to deal with

110
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,420
from a data quality point of view

111
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:52,420
when you&#39;re no longer sure what the actual value is

112
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,620
for the item that you&#39;re looking to analyze.
