(gentle music)

1
00:00:08,917 --> 00:00:10,477
- Min/max values,

2
00:00:10,477 --> 00:00:13,693
the lost secret to data quality success

3
00:00:13,693 --> 00:00:18,693
and part of the series on the data quality online academy.

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,200
So some discussion about min/max ranges.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,730
What we know is that good quality routine health data

6
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,015
is stable and consistent

7
00:00:29,015 --> 00:00:34,015
and does not yo-yo doesn&#39;t go large variations up or down.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,054
And any variations can and should be explained.

9
00:00:40,054 --> 00:00:44,940
Your number of first anti-natal visits should be constant

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,940
month in, month out with maybe some seasonal variation.

11
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:55,083
Head count should be consistent.

12
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,093
The setting of minimum and maximum ranges provides a guide

13
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:04,030
as to what the data should not exceed

14
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,900
and if used correctly assists in preventing

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,010
or limiting extreme outliers.

16
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,330
So the idea is that the min/max ranges gives you

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,370
a safety cushion within the data that can work,

18
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:19,252
that would be expected, would be usable

19
00:01:19,252 --> 00:01:23,810
and outside that you have to start and think and see

20
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,853
what&#39;s going on.

21
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,440
This means that ranges should be wide enough to accept

22
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,320
most values and narrow enough to trap values that

23
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,000
are not lucky.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
A range of one to 1000 is not a min/max range.

25
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,763
A range from 10 to 12 is not a min/max range.

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,020
Min/Max ranges are not punishment.

27
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,430
In other words, people shouldn&#39;t-

28
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,670
when they&#39;re entering the data,

29
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:58,790
keep on tripping over the messages

30
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:00,463
that this is out of range.

31
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,150
In most cases with extreme outliers,

32
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,670
we notice that they are either no min/max values preset

33
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,960
or if they are set, they are just ignored.

34
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,263
Press enter, enter and continue.

35
00:02:15,651 --> 00:02:18,530
So some considerations about min/max ranges,

36
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,653
they&#39;re used during data entry.

37
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,860
We also know that there are quite a few data elements

38
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:28,280
which can show a fair degree of fluctuation

39
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,720
that we would consider normal;

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,580
family planning supplies are a good example

41
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,420
Vaccine supplies, drug supplies,

42
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:40,970
this month, you got nothing, next month, you get 2000,

43
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,560
but it can be considered normal

44
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,253
and they are not problematic.

45
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,970
Where you&#39;ve got a disease or medical condition that

46
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,650
runs at very low numbers and slowly there is an uptake,

47
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,340
min/max ranges might help pick that one up.

48
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,760
However, where you have expected seasonal increases,

49
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,430
be careful when using min/max.

50
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,330
An example is malaria or diarrhea in children

51
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,200
in the rainy season.

52
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,300
So there are times when you have an expected

53
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,093
seasonal increase.

54
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,180
And in order to access mim/max ranges,

55
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,302
you need access or rights to the data entry screen.

56
00:03:25,302 --> 00:03:29,940
And according to the user role policy in most countries,

57
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,250
that&#39;s only granted to the people who enter data,

58
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,500
the data capturing stuff.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,440
So if you double-click on any value,

60
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,993
you will see the last 12 months of data.

61
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,980
And so the ranges promotes good data quality and alerts

62
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,740
to data that does not fit the norm,

63
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,463
doesn&#39;t fit the normal pattern.

64
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,653
And 12 months.

65
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,920
If you double-click on a value,

66
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,203
you get what is called the data information window.

67
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,950
Top left-hand corner is the comment.

68
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:12,133
And we see that this comment field is almost never used,

69
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:17,260
perhaps mainly because it&#39;s not seen.

70
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,820
And above the comment is a star, which if you click on it

71
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,233
will save it and allow you to run a follow-up analysis.

72
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,310
On the right, we see where you can set the min/max ranges,

73
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,233
you can manually set them and save it.

74
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:35,403
And we see here,

75
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,810
data in graph format for the last

76
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,883
12 months.

77
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:47,253
If we look at this data information window,

78
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:51,960
no ranges have have been set and there&#39;s a substantial

79
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,623
amount of variation.

80
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:57,758
And if you eyeball the values,

81
00:04:57,758 --> 00:05:02,758
do you think that we could manually think about ranges

82
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,963
for this specific data element for this specific facility.

83
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:15,750
And possibly, open to debate, our minimum could be four,

84
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,380
because that would track everything except the zero

85
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:22,070
and the maximum would be 18,

86
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,503
which would trap everything above the 20 line.

87
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:30,240
Just remember that this range here is only for

88
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,430
this data element for this facility.

89
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,723
It&#39;s not carried over anywhere else.

90
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,510
The other thing that we find on the data information window

91
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,643
is an audit trail.

92
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:48,196
And every time somebody changes the value,

93
00:05:48,196 --> 00:05:50,310
it keeps track of it.

94
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,330
So you can see when values were changed and updated

95
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:55,753
and who did that.

96
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:03,170
This is how you set about making min/max ranges in bulk

97
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,786
and you find this under data administration,

98
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:12,783
min/max generation, you select a dataset,

99
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,270
select an OU level, restrict your selection,

100
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,010
do not try and run it for the whole country at once.

101
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:26,710
Run it for one small area.

102
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,350
You run it for more than that, it will crash because

103
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,010
remember it has to go through every facility

104
00:06:32,010 --> 00:06:34,320
and every data element.

105
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,460
And you click generate and that will automatically

106
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,683
make it calculate.

107
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,700
So the exercise for this session is either access

108
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,670
to your own country DHIS2 or the demo database.

109
00:06:48,776 --> 00:06:51,087
If you&#39;re looking for your own country,

110
00:06:51,087 --> 00:06:55,120
DHIS2 instance, confirm if min/max rangers have been set

111
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,163
for your country.

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,623
And then if you have a staging or testing instance,

113
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,600
have a look at it, generate min/max values for one dataset

114
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,630
and a limited OU level.

115
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:15,050
If possible, open the data entry screen and view

116
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,420
the data information window.

117
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:19,273
We saw that picture earlier on.

118
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Run min/max violations for selected dataset and OU level,

119
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:29,943
remember the min/max violations is in the data quality app.

120
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,620
Write a short report of the violations,

121
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,970
in other words, where they have been triggered.

122
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,390
What is the action plan,

123
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:41,740
now that you&#39;ve got these violations?

124
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,270
What are you going to do about it?

125
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:45,570
Are we just going to ignore it,

126
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:48,020
or do you think that is something that you could do?

127
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,830
Maybe manually change some of the values,

128
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,830
discuss with the facility stop, what is the action plan?

129
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:58,522
And if you&#39;re using the demo database, follow the

130
00:07:58,522 --> 00:08:02,300
same instructions, except for you it&#39;s not a staging

131
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,456
or testing instance.

132
00:08:04,456 --> 00:08:05,593
Thank you very much.

133
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:09,516
