00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,040
- [Narrator] So another area that I feel

1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,120
we have quite a bit of control over

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,100
in terms of making recommendations

3
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,860
and supporting countries, as well as transferring

4
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,480
skills to, is in dataset design.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:14,090
So in a lot of these things that I&#39;ve shown,

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,630
I don&#39;t have the answers necessarily

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:19,070
on how to fix everything, but at least, you know,

8
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,980
you can show countries for example,

9
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,600
what to do or how to identify duplicate data elements,

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,150
how to take categories, category options,

11
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,680
and collapse them, et cetera.

12
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:32,680
So these are within our control in a certain way, right?

13
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,980
I think that data set design is also something

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,550
we can have quite a large impact on.

15
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,960
We also, you know, on top of implementing best practices,

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,260
we now have these WTO digital data packages

17
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:46,273
to also fall back upon in scenarios

18
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:48,590
to kind of refer to and say, well,

19
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,860
what about considering this approach

20
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,860
based on what we&#39;ve seen in those packages?

21
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,020
But what we can do,

22
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,390
the first thing that I wanna talk about

23
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,340
is graying out cells.

24
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,200
And this is a very simple and effective way

25
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:03,940
to prevent people from entering data.

26
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,550
And I think the majority of you would have interacted

27
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:09,600
with this in some way and already know how to do this,

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,940
but when I&#39;m creating a data set, you know,

29
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,960
if I have a whole list of desegregations

30
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,050
and the majority of my data elements

31
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:20,260
are associated with particular category option combo,

32
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,280
you know, and I just wanna maintain that,

33
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,760
but the desegregation doesn&#39;t apply

34
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,850
maybe to a small subset of data elements

35
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,140
and they shouldn&#39;t be reporting on that basically,

36
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,850
then I can gray out these cells basically,

37
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:34,450
and I can make it such that people don&#39;t enter data

38
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:35,730
into those boxes.

39
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,260
Now, of course, this is taking into account

40
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,360
that you can do this with, you know,

41
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,150
a second based form for example.

42
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,670
If you&#39;re using a HTML based form,

43
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,450
of course you can also block that off,

44
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,330
just might have to go about doing it in a different way.

45
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,090
But the whole idea is to prevent people

46
00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:52,800
from entering data where they shouldn&#39;t be entering data.

47
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,790
So sometimes you might use these desegregations

48
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,060
and it might not apply in all cases,

49
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,760
but in this example, you know,

50
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,240
if I had this OPV zero, for example,

51
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,530
and I didn&#39;t apply the same desegregation,

52
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:07,110
I just had it as a default data element,

53
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,720
because I&#39;m using a section based form for example,

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,530
I wouldn&#39;t be able to have that OPB zero data element

55
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,860
appear listed with all my other vaccinations.

56
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,020
So this can cause some challenges

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,650
with the user interface as well.

58
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,370
And we have to think about it from that perspective as well.

59
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:26,270
How are people going to actually enter that data?

60
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,010
So pass graying cells, I&#39;m not gonna harp on this too much,

61
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,070
&#39;cause I think a lot of you have a lot of experience

62
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,893
with the data set design already.

63
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,290
But the main thing is, it&#39;s kind of a summarization

64
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,240
of everything that we&#39;ve talked about so far, right?

65
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,861
If the source form itself is problematic,

66
00:02:43,861 --> 00:02:46,280
that&#39;s something you should have a look at.

67
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,160
If categories and desegregations are problematic,

68
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,700
that&#39;s also something you should have a look at.

69
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:54,600
We can make and customize things in DHIS2

70
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,100
to a large extent, but development

71
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,120
of standard operating procedures and other types of tools

72
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,420
that allow us to reflect upon what we&#39;re doing

73
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,720
are really strongly recommended.

74
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,580
If you have a look at this form,

75
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:10,190
we can see a number of different problems

76
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,510
associated with it.

77
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:14,180
I mean, the layout itself is not ideal.

78
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,070
We have a full list of age desegregations

79
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,270
and then at the end, cases and deaths by sex.

80
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,900
Now the whole problem with this,

81
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,610
I mean, this is one of my favorite examples

82
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:27,790
because I think I&#39;ve seen it in nearly every system

83
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,960
that I&#39;ve worked in.

84
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,750
Desegregation of cases and deaths,

85
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,280
and people make categories of this.

86
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,470
Now this doesn&#39;t make any sense at all, right?

87
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,940
Other than saving you some time,

88
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,820
because you don&#39;t wanna make individual data elements

89
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,990
for cases versus deaths.

90
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,980
But cases plus deaths doesn&#39;t give you

91
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:47,000
any meaningful total at all, right.

92
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,960
And then, you know, separately at the end of this form,

93
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,830
we have more desegregations,

94
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,380
just for the sake of having them.

95
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,770
So there are some things

96
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:57,290
that we can influence, I think, right?

97
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:59,980
So we have the ability to look at things

98
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,610
in a bit of detail and try to influence, well,

99
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,150
how are people going to utilize this data?

100
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,610
Because if I add up the totals for this, does it make sense?

101
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:10,090
Is it going to be easy for people

102
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,260
to find what they need to break this down

103
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,040
and desegregate this information?

104
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,100
Can I modify user interfaces,

105
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,380
either by selecting the appropriate data dimensions

106
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:21,750
or by making the form easier to interact with

107
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,710
when they&#39;re entering their data?

108
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,720
It&#39;s a lot of different things

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,620
that we have some control over, and we can influence

110
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,840
quite a bit in terms of using, you know,

111
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:33,500
what we know from our own knowledge and experience,

112
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,590
and reflecting upon this with our partners

113
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:38,440
and with countries that we&#39;re supporting.

114
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:40,630
So just keep some of these things in mind

115
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,840
as you&#39;re kind of going through different things.

116
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,530
Of course, there has been a large focus

117
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:47,680
on aggregate data, and many of you have maybe moved on

118
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,723
and are really, you know,

119
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:51,000
the aggregate implementation is so mature

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,370
that this is something that&#39;s been processed to death.

121
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,880
And you&#39;re probably thinking more about tracker data,

122
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,230
but I think that there&#39;s a lot of things

123
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,430
we can still kind of take from this,

124
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:03,130
to influence our tracker data as well.

125
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,010
All the stuff we talked about having duplicate data elements

126
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:08,770
across different programs within the same form

127
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:09,930
and within the same program,

128
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:12,010
you know, that all applies still.

129
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,190
And even when we&#39;re then making program indicators for this,

130
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,980
we have to be a bit smart about how we create them.

131
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,590
So we&#39;re not creating a bunch of program indicators

132
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:23,219
that are difficult to interpret and understand and utilize.

133
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:26,600
So what we&#39;ve talked to a lot about data input,

134
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,150
we could imagine this as data outputs as well.

135
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,710
So come at it from these two different inflection points

136
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,290
and think about, you know, how we can utilize that data

137
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,020
and what impact this has on the quality of that information.

138
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:42,820
For the most part, many of these challenges

139
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,120
that I&#39;ve shown, that we have some ability to influence

140
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,450
and also train people to identify, you know,

141
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,430
they really have a strong effect on data quality.

142
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,233
So if this is something we can impart to others,

143
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,010
you know, then we&#39;re making some good steps

144
00:05:59,010 --> 00:06:00,743
in terms of improving our systems.
