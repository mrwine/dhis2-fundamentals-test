00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,660
- [Instructor] So, in the previous set of discussions

1
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:05,930
that I&#39;ve been having about customization,

2
00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:07,300
I think that there&#39;s a lot of ways

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:10,010
we can influence our partners

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:12,290
and our organizations that we&#39;re working with

5
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:14,330
to think through some of these measures

6
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,333
or at least identify some of these challenges.

7
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:19,620
Now I&#39;d like to talk about things

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:21,630
where I didn&#39;t have the answer

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:24,400
in a lot of cases in the previous examples,

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,833
but I think that they&#39;re relatively,

11
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:29,520
they&#39;re something that we can influence,

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,930
something that we can support,

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:34,070
something that we can transfer to countries.

14
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:36,240
But then we have other problems

15
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,890
that are to do with maintenance,

16
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,460
that are maybe a bit more challenging to handle,

17
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,550
something we can have less influence on.

18
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:44,600
And it&#39;s more difficult

19
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,920
to write up procedures on supporting.

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,230
So what I want to talk about in this

21
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,300
kind of part of our demonstration

22
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,993
is talking about general maintenance challenges,

23
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,870
challenges with organization unit management,

24
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,380
challenges with users and challenges with sharing.

25
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,940
And where I am coming from from this perspective

26
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,030
is that there are challenges

27
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:09,550
basically with showing other people

28
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:11,560
to manage these things in the way they want,

29
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,650
because the user interface

30
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,960
is not really there in the same way it is

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,160
for some of the other issues

32
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,810
that I&#39;ve been discussing so far.

33
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,150
So some of the general challenges that we have,

34
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,920
well, one big challenge is batch changes to metadata.

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,450
As an example, let&#39;s say we need to correct

36
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,730
the number type of data elements.

37
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:35,050
So we have a number of data elements

38
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,600
that have the number value type associated with it.

39
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:41,753
We want to change these to positive or zero integer.

40
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,330
So what&#39;s an easy way for someone

41
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,540
who might not know how to import metadata to do this,

42
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,520
or modified metadata through the API or through SQL

43
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,020
or some other way that maybe we know how to do it?

44
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,660
Maybe us as groups know how to do,

45
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,670
but can often be challenging

46
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:03,670
to transfer to others, right?

47
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,400
Because we want to impart this knowledge to others,

48
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,420
this is something that system administrators

49
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,890
often have to deal with.

50
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:11,520
So how do we fix these types of things?

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,550
Searching and filtering is another example.

52
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:17,180
We cannot, for example, list all the data elements

53
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:20,810
associated with a particular data set or a program.

54
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,480
Now I know there are ways of doing this.

55
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,650
We can do this through the API.

56
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,830
We can do this through an SQL query,

57
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,530
but we cannot easily do this through the maintenance app.

58
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:31,450
So how do we kind of show others

59
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,480
who might not have that skill set to do this,

60
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,780
even though it&#39;s something we would expect people to do?

61
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,550
Now, so, this is something where influence

62
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,640
on how we approach these things.

63
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,840
It&#39;s not really clear at this point in time.

64
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:48,073
Dealing with unwanted objects is also often difficult.

65
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:50,660
Removing data elements with data,

66
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,890
both in aggregate and tracker,

67
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,143
can be quite significantly difficult.

68
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,940
Every time you enter a data value,

69
00:02:57,940 --> 00:03:00,260
there&#39;s then an audit type of value

70
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,910
that gets associated with that data element.

71
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,410
And there&#39;s this basically set of relationships

72
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,840
that is then created.

73
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,890
We have to remove all the dependencies

74
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:09,610
first in the correct order

75
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,880
or remove them all at once,

76
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,820
depending on what the relationships are like.

77
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,470
And then we can finally remove maybe a data element

78
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,720
we&#39;ve created and just wanted to test.

79
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,160
But this makes development processes

80
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,780
a little bit more challenging than they need to be,

81
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,960
because there&#39;s no cascading delete.

82
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,470
Now at the same time,

83
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,390
there is some good reasons for that perhaps

84
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:31,320
because you don&#39;t want people

85
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,410
to just go through your system

86
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,750
and remove necessary items,

87
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,450
but it does make it a bit difficult

88
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,600
when you need to remove things

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,513
that need to actually be removed.

90
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:43,463
Removing users is also challenging.

91
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,130
So anytime a user does something,

92
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,680
there&#39;s also relationships that are there

93
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,360
and they might just be associated

94
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,250
with maybe a private or empty dashboard

95
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,930
or something else in your system.

96
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,460
There&#39;s some relationship there

97
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,900
that is not really clear to you why that&#39;s occurring.

98
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,960
So the general processes

99
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,580
that probably many people follow is to disable users

100
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,720
and there might be some reasoning behind that,

101
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,270
but then you might find a user

102
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:12,370
who&#39;s been inactive for 12 months or two years,

103
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,630
and they&#39;re completely gone.

104
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,840
They&#39;re not associated with the health system anymore,

105
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,960
either, maybe a partner of some kind,

106
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,070
for example, that was accessing the system,

107
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:24,320
but it&#39;s now located in a completely different place.

108
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,230
And there&#39;s no real easy way

109
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,000
to delete these types of users

110
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,350
or even deleting test users that are just associated

111
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:34,403
with one or two objects somewhere in your system.

112
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:39,510
Another kind of potential challenge is merging orgunits.

113
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:43,370
So over time, if you need to modify orgunits in any way,

114
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,090
there&#39;s no real easy way to do this.

115
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:47,750
You can, there is some interface for this,

116
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,000
but it does become challenging

117
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,560
to actually implement this in practice

118
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,830
because you can also really mess things up

119
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:55,993
if you&#39;re not careful.

120
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,920
And of course, when you do any of these operations,

121
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,810
that the feedback is very limited,

122
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,160
particularly through the user interface.

123
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,940
So we can access the log and we can pull out

124
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,910
this information perhaps and see

125
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,370
exactly what the dependency is,

126
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,610
which table it&#39;s referencing,

127
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,900
and what we need to do to remove it.

128
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,780
But this does not really translate well

129
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
to working with our partners

130
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,330
and our countries all the time,

131
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,360
compared to a lot of the other operations

132
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,560
that we&#39;ve talked about.

133
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,610
So from that perspective,

134
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,140
let&#39;s take a look at organization unit management first.

135
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:41,410
So we&#39;ve talked a bit about things like completeness,

136
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,480
and we certainly talked a lot about categories,

137
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,640
desegregations from categories.

138
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,170
Now, organization unit group sets

139
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,150
are another type of desegregation.

140
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:53,170
And we haven&#39;t talked about that too much so far,

141
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,520
other than knowing that it is a data dimension

142
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,820
that we should consider whether or not we to use

143
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,660
as one directly in our analysis tools,

144
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,790
but using these organization units

145
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,030
to analyze our data is obviously critical.

146
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,690
Everything about completeness associated

147
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,560
with our organization units here,

148
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,080
or sorry, is tied to our organization units.

149
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,000
We also want to be able to desegregate

150
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,710
by various organization unit group sets, right?

151
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,890
So by type, by ownership, whatever it might be,

152
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,640
whatever are the common kind

153
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,030
of organization unit groups and group sets

154
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:28,150
that you&#39;ve created in your system

155
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,260
for people to desegregate data down further by.

156
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,740
So this become critical to manage.

157
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,740
Obviously, we know organization units

158
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:39,440
are the backbone of many systems

159
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,380
and there&#39;s all kinds of other areas

160
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,950
that they affect on system design,

161
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,450
but we&#39;ll limit the scope

162
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:48,230
to kind of more focusing on the data quality

163
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,110
and data use aspect.

164
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,040
So what are the best practices

165
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,660
for actually managing these orgunits?

166
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:57,900
So, also writing down who does what

167
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,060
for organization units is very important.

168
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,710
So if you have any standard operating procedures on this,

169
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:05,990
that&#39;s very important to establish.

170
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,320
That&#39;s more of a proactive solution

171
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,860
than kind of trying to fix things after the fact,

172
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,910
because it does help you kind of train people

173
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:16,500
to do this a bit more,

174
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,500
but actually implementing decentralized

175
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,470
organization unit management can be very difficult.

176
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:22,770
You might only have a central team

177
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,950
who&#39;s managing literally thousands of organization units.

178
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,750
And this can become challenging

179
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,473
to kind of keep that up to date.

180
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,710
Also for data set assignment,

181
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,220
because data set assignment

182
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,023
has a big effect on completeness,

183
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,500
we often take shortcuts when we do this.

184
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,037
So maybe we&#39;ll just say,

185
00:07:43,037 --> 00:07:46,520
&quot;Assign my data set to the facility level,&quot;

186
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,510
but who&#39;s actually reporting on that data set?

187
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,620
Is it every facility?

188
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,970
Is it a subset of facilities?

189
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,630
Are there facilities who aren&#39;t reporting

190
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,220
and this is contributing to a lower reporting rate?

191
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:01,150
So these types of things can have a direct effect

192
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:04,410
actually on what we see in our analysis

193
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,810
when we&#39;re performing various items.

194
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:11,120
So there are different ways to assign basically.

195
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,930
There&#39;s not good ways through the interface, so, right?

196
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:18,530
So that&#39;s a bit of a challenge as well.

197
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:20,810
How do we transfer this down to to others

198
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,020
when everything that might,

199
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,740
when a lot of things I should say

200
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,640
that would be useful perhaps,

201
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,820
we have to come up with a different solution

202
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,873
to implement in practice.
