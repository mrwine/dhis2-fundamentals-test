0
00:00:00,792 --> 00:00:03,375
(upbeat music)

1
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,410
- As we have seen, the dashboard

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,683
of the data quality tool is easy to use.

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,620
A limitation of the dashboard of the application, however,

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,590
is that it can only be used to review

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:26,460
those indicators or data elements

6
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,473
for which the dashboard has been configured.

7
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,830
We&#39;ll next see how we can use the analysis function

8
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,340
of the WHO data quality tool

9
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:44,740
to look for outliers or inconsistencies

10
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:50,970
between any data elements which have data in the dhis2,

11
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:59,140
let&#39;s start by looking at how we use analysis consistency.

12
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,010
When we select analysis consistency,

13
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:12,010
a window appears asking us to select the type

14
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,370
of consistency we want to analyze.

15
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:20,280
Consistency over time is equivalent

16
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:25,280
to what we saw on the consistency time dashboard.

17
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:30,620
Whereas consistency between indicators is the equivalent

18
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:35,053
of what we saw on the consistency data dashboard.

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,250
For the example I will now present,

20
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:44,250
we want to analyze further dropout rates, and to do that

21
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:49,003
we select consistency between indicators,

22
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,103
then click on expected result.

23
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,470
And it&#39;s now possible to select dropout

24
00:01:58,470 --> 00:02:00,853
as the type of analysis.

25
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:07,920
We next need to decide which two indicators

26
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,163
will define the dropout rate.

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,700
Let&#39;s look at the Penta 1 to Penta 3 dropout rate.

28
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,310
To do that, we have to first select Penta 1.

29
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,730
And for that, we need to find out which indicator,

30
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,593
which data element group to select.

31
00:02:34,342 --> 00:02:36,320
And if we select immunization,

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:41,320
we find that Penta 1 given before 12 months of age

33
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:47,090
is a data element in the immunization, eight element group.

34
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,380
Next, we need to select Penta 3

35
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,980
given before 12 months of age.

36
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,003
Again, we need to select the data element group,

37
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,713
immunization.

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,870
And the immunization data element group includes

39
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,130
Penta third doses given before 12 months of age.

40
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:17,080
So already you see some of the challenge

41
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,690
of using the analysis function,

42
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,080
in that we need to configure it

43
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:27,110
and to configure it, we need to know

44
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,300
what is the data element group or indicator group

45
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,220
we want to select from, what is the data element

46
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:38,420
or indicator we want to select and so forth.

47
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:42,520
This configuration requires that the user be familiar

48
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:46,260
with how the data sets are organized.

49
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,650
So this is not a function that can easily be used

50
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,300
by the beginner,

51
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,980
but we&#39;ve now set up to look at the dropout rate

52
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,460
between Penta 1, given before 12 months,

53
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,680
and Penta 3, given before 12 months.

54
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,330
Now we only need to select the period,

55
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,750
let&#39;s select last month, last year, as the period

56
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,750
and disaggregate by district, then click on analyze.

57
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,630
The screen shows us a chart

58
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,460
that is identical to what we saw

59
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,563
on the consistency data dashboard.

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,950
But, in addition to this histogram with one bar

61
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,030
for each district and two districts

62
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:39,710
that have a negative dropout rate,

63
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:44,710
we have a table, and the table shows us the number

64
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:49,250
of first doses of Penta given by each district

65
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,933
and the number of third doses given by each district.

66
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:57,519
And it shows this for these two districts

67
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:59,323
with negative dropout rates,

68
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:04,917
that the number of third doses given in 2019

69
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,270
was greater than the number of first doses.

70
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,190
So we get this additional information

71
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,703
when we use the analysis function.

72
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,870
We can select one of these districts

73
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:25,870
by clicking on the row and the row turns light yellow.

74
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,673
When we do that,

75
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:31,800
a table with a single row

76
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,230
for district A-2 appears at the bottom of the screen

77
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,410
and a chart showing,

78
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:43,330
for each month over the 12 month period,

79
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:47,360
the value of Penta 1 and the value of Penta 3,

80
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,223
and notice what we see.

81
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:55,540
For most months, we see that district A-2 reported

82
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,610
a higher number of third doses of Penta

83
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,623
than first doses of Penta.

84
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,530
For example, in may of 2019, 1063 first doses,

85
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:12,840
but 1,139 third doses.

86
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:17,220
So district A-2 has a consistent practice

87
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:21,660
of reporting higher numbers of third doses of Penta vaccine,

88
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,750
than first doses of Penta vaccine.

89
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,730
And then for November of the 12 month period,

90
00:06:29,730 --> 00:06:33,930
there&#39;s this quite suspicious value that may be due

91
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,800
to an error in data entry because the number

92
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,050
of third doses is so much greater

93
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,950
than the number of first doses.

94
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,080
But for these other months,

95
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,080
there seems to be some habit of reporting higher numbers

96
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,360
of third doses, just a bit higher

97
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,900
than first doses of Penta vaccine.

98
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,690
We can continue the investigation by clicking

99
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:05,023
on the menu icon at the end of this single row.

100
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,193
And we&#39;re allowed to drill down.

101
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:16,670
What we now see is a histogram

102
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,710
that disaggregates the Penta 1

103
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:23,680
to Penta 3 dropout rate from 2019,

104
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,830
by individual health facility.

105
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,500
And we see that almost all the health facilities

106
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:36,500
of district A-2 have been reporting higher numbers

107
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,560
of third doses than first doses of Penta vaccine.

108
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,233
Most all of the facilities have negative dropout rates.

109
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,580
We can again, select one of these health facilities,

110
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,890
one of these rows

111
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,620
and look at the trend over the 12 month period

112
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,980
and the values for the self facility.

113
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,353
And we see that this one facility, 197,

114
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:11,430
again, appears to have some kind of a very suspicious value

115
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,620
that is probably erroneous,

116
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:19,070
where it has reported 10 times as many third doses

117
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:21,313
as first doses of Penta vaccine.

118
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:26,260
So in summary, by using the analysis function

119
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:29,643
and looking at analysis of dropout rates,

120
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:35,200
we get additional information that allows us to investigate

121
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,540
and determine is the negative dropout rate

122
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:43,540
for a district due to a single erroneous value,

123
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,690
a single outlier such as here,

124
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:51,280
or is it due to a pattern, amongst

125
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,220
many different health facilities,

126
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:58,810
and for many different months of reporting higher numbers

127
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,983
of third doses than first doses.

128
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:08,630
Let&#39;s look at one more example before we then see

129
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:12,423
how we can use analysis to look at outliers.

130
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:16,440
With this example, we&#39;re going to look

131
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,870
at analysis between indicators,

132
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:24,120
but this time we&#39;re going to look at two indicators

133
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:27,090
that we expect to be roughly equivalent.

134
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:32,070
And in this case, we&#39;re going to compare third doses

135
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,573
of Penta vaccine,

136
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,390
to third doses of OPV vaccine.

137
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:42,750
These two vaccines are typically given on the same visit,

138
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:46,360
so we expect the values to be roughly the same.

139
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,143
Again, setting period to 2019,

140
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:55,123
disaggregation to district, click on analyze.

141
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:58,640
And we see a scatter plot,

142
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,640
which reassures us that indeed, for all of the districts,

143
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:08,720
the value of third doses of Penta vaccine is closely related

144
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,000
to the value of third doses of OPV vaccine.

145
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,550
And we could, if we wanted to, do some investigation.

146
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,750
Although, the fact that all of these dots are

147
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:25,813
between the two gray lines reassures us.

148
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:32,010
Let&#39;s look next at how to use the analysis function

149
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,783
to check for outliers and missing data.

150
00:10:37,050 --> 00:10:42,050
The function works just as the outlier dashboard does,

151
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,130
except it is much more flexible in that it allows us

152
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:50,500
to select any data element at all,

153
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:54,680
not just the ones that are configured for the dashboard.

154
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,800
In fact, we could select from

155
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:04,753
multiple data sets and multiple data element groups.

156
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,953
We could even

157
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,753
select

158
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,700
all data elements

159
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,493
from a data element group.

160
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,750
Set period to last 12 months,

161
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,673
organization unit to disaggregation by district, analyze,

162
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,433
we&#39;re waiting for the data to process.

163
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,773
And we get the table,

164
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,170
showing us all of the suspicious values

165
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:47,463
for the selected data elements.

166
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:53,430
It has the same options as with the outlier dashboard.

167
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,430
So we can filter to identify only the most suspicious values

168
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:04,323
or we can filter, if we are at facility level.

169
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,210
We can use it to identify facilities

170
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,253
that have large amounts of missing data.

171
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,640
In summary, the analysis function works in a way

172
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,450
that is quite similar to the dashboard

173
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:24,010
of the WHO data quality tool,

174
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:26,113
but it is much more flexible.

175
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:31,140
The price that you pay for using the analysis function is

176
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,570
that you have to configure it and to do that,

177
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:39,570
you need to be familiar with how the data sets are organized

178
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,980
and you need to find just the data element or indicator
